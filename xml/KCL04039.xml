<p>March 12, 1908 - September 5, 2003 </p><p> Milton Konvitz, a Cornell University faculty member and authority on constitutional and labor law, and civil and human rights, died Sept. 5 at the age of 95. Konvitz was a founding faculty member in the School of Industrial and Labor Relations from 1946 until his retirement in 1973. He was also a professor in Cornell's Law School. </p><p> Konvitz is perhaps best known for his American Ideals course, which he taught to more than 8,000 students over the course of his career, never giving the same lecture twice. "I saw the U.S. Constitution as it has been interpreted as a magnificent depository of our ideals, both individual and social," he said. His course exposed students to the great intellectual thinkers and philosophers throughout history whose writings had shaped those ideals. They included Sophocles, whose play Antigone is Cornell's New Student Reading Project this year. One student he influenced was U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Cornell Class of 1954, who considers him a mentor. </p><p> At Cornell Konvitz also was a founder of the university's Department of Near Eastern Studies and Program of Jewish Studies. "I felt it was essential for a college interested in the humanities not to leave out Hebrew language and literature," he said. "And the knowledge of Jewish history, which began 4,000 years ago and has contributed to civilization no less than Greek, Roman or English history, is important to today's students -Jewish and non-Jewish." He often hosted students at his Ithaca home and helped start the first Kosher dining option at Cornell, Young Israel House. </p><p> In addition, for nearly 30 years he directed the Liberian Codification Project, which drew up the official body of statutory laws that is still in force in the Republic of Liberia today, despite the current political upheaval there. Konvitz also edited the opinions of Liberia's Supreme Court and received the Grand Band of the Order of the Star of Africa, the highest award given to foreigners, as well as an honorary degree from the University of Liberia, one of seven honorary degrees he received in his lifetime. </p><p> Active as a scholar and writer until his death, he wrote books and articles on American constitutional law that won him wide recognition and were cited in U.S. Supreme Court opinions. Among his nine books is Fundamental Liberties of a Free People: Religion, Speech, Press, Assembly, which was republished earlier this year with an expanded introduction by him that is strongly critical of the Rehnquist Supreme Court. Other books include A Century of Civil Rights (1983) and Judaism and Human Rights (2nd ed. 2001). He also edited a dozen volumes, including two on American philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson, whose thinking shaped his views. One Emersonian idea he absorbed was that readers give life to books, which Konvitz recast as follows: "It is in their hearing that students bring life to the words, the thoughts, the teacher." </p><p> Konvitz was born in Safed, Palestine (now Israel ), in 1908, the son of a rabbi. He immigrated to the United States in 1915 and became a naturalized citizen in 1926. He received a bachelor's degree in 1929 and a law degree in 1930, both from New York University, and a Ph.D. in philosophy from Cornell in 1933. Before joining Cornell's faculty, he was one of three assistant general counsels to Thurgood Marshall at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund for three years. </p><p> He is survived by his wife, Mary, of Oakhurst, N.J.; a brother, Phillip, of Elberon, N.J.; a son and daughter-in-law, Josef and Isa, of Paris, France; and two grandsons, Eli and Ezra. Josef Konvitz, who grew up in Ithaca, is now an official at the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.</p>  </bioghist>

Professor Konvitz mentions in a letter to Chimon Abramsky that he no longer subscribes to the New York Review of Books because he "got a little tired of its dogmatic Leftism, and of the control that Noam Chomsky and I.F. Stone seemed to have over who writes what," (November 1, 1974). Konvitz wrote to congratulate the Honorable Shimon Agranat, Chief Justice of the Israeli Supreme Court, on retiring. Konvitz draws a comparison between the Courts of Israel and the United States and compliments Agranat on a significant role in the formation of the Israeli Court (September 20, 1976). In a letter to Professor Sydney E. Ahlstrom, Yale University, Doctor Konvitz requests references to sources which discuss the influence of Emerson on Friedrich W. Nietzsche and mentions Emerson's influence on his own world view (June 2, 1978). Personal letter from Konvitz to Mister Gershon Jacobson and Mister Nissan Gordon regarding Konvitz's reasons for not renewing his subscription to the Algemeine Journal. Doctor Konvitz explains that although he was "brought up" with a respect and even love for Yiddish newspapers, he found the Algemeine to be too narrow, "not Jewish but rabbinical and clerical, and even the rabbinism that it cultivates is limited to that which characterizes a part of Brooklyn and the Lower East Side," (July 5, 1975).</p></scopecontent></c02><c02 id="aspace_123eee644abfaa83d8fb1f64d9f5dab0" level="file"><did><unittitle>A - General.</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1946/1980" type="inclusive">1946-1980</unitdate><container id="aspace_21ac58b5794c93d8e653308491e98ce9" label="unspecified [31924079342352]" type="box">1</container><container id="aspace_aadd5ae825b6e4596696e5180591d5ac" parent="aspace_21ac58b5794c93d8e653308491e98ce9" type="folder">2</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_8e3333a1acf4acbe6ea428b0199a8562"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>[1946-1955]-1980. Correspondence with Professor Carl A. Auerbach, University of Wisconsin Law School, regarding the selection of texts for undergraduates. Konvitz prefers not to use the same readings twice to keep the course interesting (1950); Regarding Konvitz's text, Fundamental Liberties, Auerbach is in disagreement on some basic issues. Auerbach does not believe "that the clear and present danger is a 'constitutional jewel' if legislation curtailing totalitarian movements is in question." Professor Auerbach directs Konvitz to Auerbach's article, "The Communist Control Act of 1954: A Proposed Legal-Political Theory of Free Speech," which addresses this question. Exchange of letters with Charles Abrams regarding Stuyvesant Town Case (1947); David Selden, in response to Selden's interest in establishing an American Federation of Teachers local at Cornell University with Konvitz's help, Professor Konvitz informs him that the attitude of the Industrial and Labor Relations professors is that they should not become members of any organization identified with either labor or management (1954); With George M. Houser, Executive Director, American Committee on Africa regarding Committee's request that Konvitz sign a position paper on "The United States and South Africa." Konvitz declines because he believes that the statement's contents relating to the war in Vietnam are irrelevant to its purpose and in some instances unjustified although Professor Konvitz opposed the Vietnam War. He would sign the statement on South Africa if it were limited to the topic (1968); with Louis H. Glickman, Western New York State Regional Director, Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, regarding Konvitz's concern that the Cornell Club of Buffalo no longer meet at the Buffalo Athletic Club because it discriminated against Blacks (1969); routine correspondence. Last few letters in the folder with Avital of the "Hebrew Culture Foundation" - there are several folders on the Foundation also to be found under "H" in another series of this collection.</p></scopecontent></c02><c02 id="aspace_f4407ffbfdee2e70061d1553a96bf599" level="file"><did><unittitle>"Personal A-AL."</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1935/1966" type="inclusive">1935-1966</unitdate><container id="aspace_154c5ee709cf58e035fdc087ff80559a" label="unspecified [31924079342352]" type="box">1</container><container id="aspace_d161989c78848c2bf62a5f6b131e06ed" parent="aspace_154c5ee709cf58e035fdc087ff80559a" type="folder">3</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_cb4f92b84c35d8695b984881639a3ec0"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Personal correspondence including letter dated January 1935 from Samuel Alexander on Konvitz's thesis.</p></scopecontent></c02><c02 id="aspace_103c954fb5075437cfa615a557b8dd19" level="file"><did><unittitle>Agency for International Development.

Correspondence with Israel S. Chipkin, Executive Director, American Association for Jewish Education, regarding Association activities and meetings. Chipkin disagrees with Konvitz's article in Commentary which deals with religion in Israel (November 1949). Professor Konvitz explains the intention and meaning of his Chicago address which he believes Chipkin had "mis-read." Konvitz also defends his article in Commentary. Konvitz agrees that every bureau of Jewish education should respect diversities of opinion and that there is no orthodoxy. He explains his tolerance for differences of opinion and his philosophy "is to look for points of agreement rather than for points of difference in my relations to other persons and in my relations to social movements I am not afraid of differences, and I do love similarity, but one does not swallow up the other." He mentions that he was drawn to the Industrial and Labor Relations school "precisely for the reason that our policy here is to find points of agreement between management and labor and in all other social problems with which we are concerned," (May 19). Also included is a document by Konvitz "Quotations from 'Judaism and the Democratic Ideal,'" excerpts from his paper for the main address at the Opening Session of the 1948 American Association for Jewish Education annual Meeting (May 1948).

Konvitz responds to the draft of the agreement between the American Association for Jewish Education and the Department of Education and Culture. Doctor Konvitz suggests that the phraseology of the agreement should be more neutral and avoid such statements as "the morality of Israel in Arab relations;" "the right of Israel to the land." Also, Konvitz does not believe that it is the purpose of the American Association for Jewish Education to contribute to bringing youth and adults to "live in Israel," (November 12, 1971). Konvitz accepts Arnow's invitation to serve as a member of the National Commission to guide and advise the American Association for Jewish Education in the development of policy, program and curriculum materials for Jewish studies in public high schools and colleges (November 1972 [?] and June 1970)</p></scopecontent></c02><c02 id="aspace_5235661c5cd342d47e4f4615d77f1c96" level="file"><did><unittitle>American Association for Jewish Education - Aharon Kessler.</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1946/1951" type="inclusive">1946-1951</unitdate><container id="aspace_f54cf3e1bb891a07c63a83f9f850bdf1" label="unspecified [31924079342378]" type="box">2</container><container id="aspace_caa27f5af717775a6a1ce80cb7d16fb2" parent="aspace_f54cf3e1bb891a07c63a83f9f850bdf1" type="folder">4</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_4117014df601c7f3d1a21d87d8974a7f"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Correspondence with Doctor Aharon Kessler, Director, Community Service and Consultation.

Konvitz explains the advisability - and urgency - of American Association for Jewish Education interest in and concern with Jewish education in the area of American higher education." Konvitz emphasizes the need for Jewish education on university and college campuses and notes that Hillel directors on American campuses are rabbis and not teachers. Hillel provides educational services only marginally and does not have enough financial support to address students' educational needs. Also, Konvitz stresses the importance of educating non-Jewish students about Judaism and Jews on a level worthy of the respect of university professors and students (January 20, 1956). In a letter to Lown honoring his 65th birthday, Konvitz praises Lown's contribution to the Jewish community (November 12, 1955).

Correspondence from Roger Baldwin, American Civil Liberties Union founder. Baldwin praises Konvitz's book on immigration. Correspondence with Arthur Garfield Hayes, Doctor Konvitz states that he is not in favor of a statute against group defamation (September 5, 1947). Correspondence with George E. Rundquist regarding the areas in which the President of the United States may eliminate racial segregation by executive order. Konvitz believes that the President, by executive order, could prohibit racial segregation in the armed forces, but that this is the only area (May 5, 1949). Correspondence with Baldwin regarding American Civil Liberties Union request that Konvitz prepare legislation on civil rights which the American Civil Liberties Union would offer to the President's Committee on Civil Rights. Konvitz declines but refers the American Civil Liberties Union to his two books and makes several suggestions for drafting the bills (January 8, 1947). Baldwin refers to Konvitz's book as the best and only thorough study made and discusses the drafting of amendments to the federal civil rights laws for the President's commission (December 27, 1946). Konvitz also suggests that the penalties in the existing civil rights act should be considerably increased (January 17, 1947). Also includes correspondence with other American Civil Liberties Union officers including Herbert M. Levy, Staff Counsel, and Clifford Forster, Staff Council, regarding Konvitz's requests for various briefs and cases and routine publication concerns of Konvitz.</p></scopecontent></c02><c02 id="aspace_f61d672a6d684764703b325d0241ce2c" level="file"><did><unittitle>American Civil Liberties Union Biennial Conference 1970-1971.</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1980/1980">1980</unitdate><container id="aspace_c2d6327fa50641d3aabdf63283171126" label="unspecified [31924079342394]" type="box">5</container><container id="aspace_f483a9ccd03c9e11271aefdcfd88f9d6" parent="aspace_c2d6327fa50641d3aabdf63283171126" type="folder">5</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_97b479637566429edec45c1cb50a589a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Routine materials.</p></scopecontent></c02><c02 id="aspace_25839a1387440f5315765b411bec5a73" level="file"><did><unittitle>American Civil Liberties Union Board of Directors.</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1970/1971" type="inclusive">1970-1971</unitdate><container id="aspace_cb3365a3b385950d232eec44cc607fed" label="unspecified [31924079342394]" type="box">5</container><container id="aspace_6bc51ff506a5a7a9ac0d83783a82ea21" parent="aspace_cb3365a3b385950d232eec44cc607fed" type="folder">6</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_11073b40018ed4130d4cee560d9c130f"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Routine Materials.</p></scopecontent></c02><c02 id="aspace_c19476c2fc11031824a521eb2e2682bf" level="file"><did><unittitle>American Civil Liberties Union Board of Directors</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1965/1971" type="inclusive">1965-1971</unitdate><container id="aspace_ce86d690619eb91e9255cc410dd2b0a4" label="unspecified [31924079342394]" type="box">5</container><container id="aspace_5881b545b0a605800b12b993cc7d3e84" parent="aspace_ce86d690619eb91e9255cc410dd2b0a4" type="folder">7</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_368434725c0bf91fb1cb61b7be8afd52"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Includes memorandums and minutes of various committees, working documents not for public distribution and other American Civil Liberties Union materials.</p></scopecontent></c02><c02 id="aspace_90e48f172d7f3007bfb5385dcdb7fd41" level="file"><did><unittitle>American Civil Liberties Union - Central New York Chapter - Upstate New York Division.</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1960/1969" type="inclusive">1960-1969</unitdate><container id="aspace_b479fe7e4923e75def7340fc8f0021d5" label="unspecified [31924079342394]" type="box">5</container><container id="aspace_96f1dc3361f3c053a29c96aab9a2128f" parent="aspace_b479fe7e4923e75def7340fc8f0021d5" type="folder">8</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_f66177ef032be3f87c8964cc4ecf23c3"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>1960, 1963-1964, 1966-1969.

Their correspondence mainly concerns Committee activities and policies. Correspondence and memorandums regarding American Committee for Cultural Freedom statements about Professor Owen Lattimore; regarding American Committee for cultural Freedom projects including a proposed study of the activities of the American Communist Party in the field of civil liberties (March 5, 1956) and regarding American Committee for Cultural Freedom position toward the National Lawyers Guild (May 20, 1954).

Konvitz advised the American Committee for Cultural Freedom executive committee that the American Committee for Cultural Freedom should not make any public statements about Lattimore while Lattimore's case is pending in the courts (January 17, 1955). Konvitz argues that the American Committee for Cultural Freedom should not impose any sanction on people who have cried out against "the crime" committed against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. Konvitz agrees to serve as an advisor to a project to study the effect of the government's security and loyalty regulations and procedures upon the academic and scientific communities (July 1, 1954) and accepts membership on a Legal Commission which will act in an advisory capacity to the American Committee for Cultural Freedom (December 28, 1953).

Correspondence with S. Andhil Fineberg regarding the American Jewish Committee's promotion of Konvitz's article on church-state relations. Correspondence with Nathan Schachner regarding the possibility of Doctor Konvitz writing some articles for magazines of national circulation. Schachner explains that the American Jewish Committee is interested in placing articles in national magazines which were written by prominent Jews and that disassociate the public's perceived relationship between Jews and Communists and between liberals and Communists. Schachner suggests that Konvitz could explain 1) that the American Jewish labor movement, especially in the garment industry, has been non-Communist and liberal in tendencies and 2) liberal thought is opposed to the totalitarianism of Communism (February 24, 1948).</p></scopecontent></c02><c02 id="aspace_4fa6bfdc043a4a2b95cc41df00d1d481" level="file"><did><unittitle>American Jewish Committee Task Force on Group Status in America.</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1973/1980" type="inclusive">1973-1980</unitdate><container id="aspace_3136f9b86fed423b3a6d30042a18d76f" label="unspecified [31924079342428]" type="box">7</container><container id="aspace_7552ca91ddc5e0552ed97cd70f485188" parent="aspace_3136f9b86fed423b3a6d30042a18d76f" type="folder">6</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_8e48685922ec67fbc169dd69fe3022c2"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>1973, 1977-[1980]. Memorandum from Konvitz to Peter I. Rose and Irving M. Levine, Staff Director, regarding the Task Force. Konvitz advises that the Task Force avoid taking stands on broad general public policy issues such as bilingual and bi-cultural education. Konvitz believes that the Task Force should formulate policies on issues which are relevant to special Jewish concerns such as religious liberty, separation of church and state and a fair and humane immigration policy (with special concern for refugees). In these areas there is a Jewish group interest and, therefore, the American Jewish Committee as a Jewish group can join others in working for a particular end (for example, a policy of aliens' protection). Konvitz believes that the American Jewish Committee has failed to formulate a policy on affirmative action that would make it very clear that the American Jewish Committee as a Jewish group is concerned with "both justice and compassion." Konvitz also discusses recent articles which he has read and his own observations tend to be more anti-Semitic than their conservative counterparts. Konvitz suggests that since American conservatives are in control of the Senate and White House, the Jewish community "might reconsider its own heavy investment in the liberal side of American politics." Other routine Task Force memorandums, copies of papers and articles on ethnicity and a paper on reverse discrimination.</p></scopecontent></c02><c02 id="aspace_75834f36398085cc5f70cb3d94ac2dda" level="file"><did><unittitle>American Jewish Committee Task Force on Israel-American Relations.</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1975/1977" type="inclusive">1975-1977</unitdate><container id="aspace_8a2a262060e937f26bfee6651443f212" label="unspecified [31924079342428]" type="box">7</container><container id="aspace_2b4c1b51caecd687d8374f51925aa205" parent="aspace_8a2a262060e937f26bfee6651443f212" type="folder">7</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_1a7255f53a0460ad07af760c1a19565a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Summaries of the Steering Committee meetings of the special Task Force on Israel-American Jewry Interaction.

This edition is intended to serve as an unofficial document which would deal with the major subject matter areas that might be included in a Special Report of the President. Such a Special Report would be used to supplement the President's "State of the Union Message" by considering many "quality of life" subjects only barely touched on, if at all, by the Economic Report and the Budget Message.

Copy of a letter from Billikopf to Irene DuPont of the DuPont Company regarding a comment by DuPont concerning an alliance between Communists and some Jews. Billikopf describes a substantial contribution by the DuPonts in 1917-1918 to the American Jewish Relief Committee (July 21, 1950). Professor Konvitz comments on the reaction to his Chicago address of the Yiddish Press and American Zionists. Konvitz's speech was received with hostility from these groups and although some people privately expressed agreement with Konvitz's concern about the problem of freedom in Israel, no one has spoken on his behalf; and the central issues that Konvitz discussed have been neglected (May 6, 1949). Konvitz discusses his disagreement with Goodenough regarding Wolfson's Philo (October 12, 1948). Konvitz comments that he approves "with all my heart" Billikopf's letter in the Times regarding the appeal for funds by Negro colleges. Konvitz also mentions that few decisions he has had to make were more difficult than his decision not to accept a position on the Howard Law School faculty (April 9, 1948).

Correspondence with David Fellman, Vilas Professor of Political Science, University of Wisconsin, and President of the American Association of University Professors, regarding Konvitz's book, Expanding Liberties, with regard to judicial review of Congressional legislation; the clear and present danger test; the importance of David Hume's contributions to American intellectual history and, particularly, James Madison's theory on factions; the role of Catholicism in Al Smith's political defeat, etcetera. Doctor Konvitz mentions that he is very interested in Hume's philosophy and that Hume is an important concern in his course in jurisprudence (June 10 and 16, 1966). Correspondence with Fellman regarding Konvitz's book Religious Liberty and Conscience; and the problems of defining conscience and referring to conscience as a standard (November 29 and December 12, 1968). Konvitz comments on voting procedures at American Association of University Professors annual meetings and on the importance of following the reports of Committee A that concludes that censure is not warranted on the facts found (May 1, 1964).

Professor Konvitz also mentions that he does not believe that the American Civil Liberties Union should have undertaken to represent the Nazis. He argues that the American Civil Liberties Union is not obliged to accept every case that is presented to it and that their refusal of the case would not imply that the American Civil Liberties Union is in opposition to what the Nazi party demanded from the City of Skokie. It would only imply that the American Civil Liberties Union decided to use its limited resources on other cases (April 18, 1978). A copy of the statement by the Sarasota-Manatee Committee Against the Nazi march in Skokie. Other correspondence regarding routine personal matters. Correspondence with Senator Philip A. Hart, United States Senate. Konvitz sent Hart an article on the filibuster of the nomination of Abe Fontas which appeared in the October 25, 1968 Cornell Daily Sun.

While Konvitz comments that he does not question the right of Jewish organizations to take positions on public matters with respect to individual action, he does know that his Jewish conscience is different fro that of others who are Christian. Doctor Konvitz remarks that "conscience is a God-given gift that makes all of us speak more clearly to Jews than to Christians."

The project included a quantitative study of the court records of New York and Kings Counties with the purpose of uncovering all the labor injunctions which were litigated from 1935 to June 1950. Also, the project included a study of the impact of the injunctions on collective bargaining relationships, which was accomplished by interviewing prominent lawyers involved in labor practice and by conducting some case studies of situations in which the injunction had been used. The study was included in the Senate Report, "State Court Injunctions," Senate Document Number 7, Eighty-First Congress, Second Session. Jacob Seidenberg conducted the study under Konvitz's supervision.

Kallen informs Konvitz that he has suggested to Simon Sobeloff, United States Solicitor General, that he seek Konvitz's advice regarding the problem of defending civil liberties. Kallen praises Sobeloff, commenting that he is among the few Jews whose stand is uncompromising and who is yet able to combine courage and tact with principle (April 30, 1954). Konvitz comments on a meeting between himself and Maxwell Rabb in the White House offices. Konvitz mentions that his one and a half hour long interview with Rabb was entirely devoted to a discussion of the grievances of the Republican Party and the Eisenhower administration against American Jews. Doctor Konvitz believes that he straightened Rabb out on one or two important points. One extremely important point was the charge that American Jews determine their political activities and loyalties solely by the demands of Israeli politics. Konvitz pointed out that this was not the case regarding either Senator Taft or Senator McCarthy. Konvitz made it clear to Rabb that Zionism alone did not determine the political allegiance of American Jews. Konvitz mentions that he also made it clear to Rabb that the Republican Party has failed to win the respect and devotion of not only the Jews, but also the blacks. Also discussed were Konvitz's Liberian project, relations with the Labor Department, and the importance of relations of the New York State School of Industrial and Labor Relations with unions. Konvitz mentions that the President of the New School has asked him if he is interested in succeeding Frieda Wunderlich as Dean of Graduate Faculty. Also Shad Polier asked Konvitz to become chairman of Law and Social Action. Konvitz declines both offers (November 20, 1953). Kallen discusses Ames' transactionalism (August 27, 1953), McCarthy's campaign against Communism (July 25 and May 8, 1953), and the Rosenbergs' conviction (July 10, 1953). Konvitz mentions that he has agreed to become involved in some labor disputes as a National Enforcement Commissioner of the Economic Stabilization Agency (May 7, 1953). Konvitz briefly comments on Professor Martin Buber's April 8, 1952 visit to Cornell, which Doctor Konvitz had arranged (April 9, 1952). Kallen comments that Jewish studies in colleges and universities should not be segregated in such academic departments as Semitic Departments or relegated to a Theological School. Also discussed is a labor dispute at Cornell as well as the American Jewish Congress. Konvitz mentions that he spoke in Philadelphia on civil rights under the auspices of the Philadelphia Fellowship Commission. Konvitz comments that the talk turned into a debate between Morris L. Ernst and himself. Konvitz also mentions that he is wondering whether he should resign as an officer of the American Association for Jewish Education because his continued affiliation and sometimes unpopular opinions might hinder its work. Kallen comments on Konvitz's speech to the American Council for Judaism. Kallen supports Konvitz's position (May 2 and 4, April 20 and 29, 1949, and others). Other correspondence with Kallen in which a number of other topics are discussed in detail including the American Jewish Congress, the American Association for Jewish Education, Konvitz's work and publications, Kallen's work and publications, American Zionism, Jewish education, American liberalism, "Judaism," McCarthyism, the New School and publications. Discussion of other issues including disarmament, theology, Kallen's humanism, the National Lawyers Guild, Sidney Hook, transactionalism, Abba Eban, national politics, and the politics and problems of the various committees in which they are involved.

Kallen. Professor Konvitz comments on Cornell, its library, and academic administration (October 11, 1962). Kallen discusses Jewish education (January 31, 1962), his suggestion to the Civil War Centennial Commission regarding a celebration of the Emancipation Proclamation. Doctor Konvitz mentions that George Sabine and Henry Myers were his two closest friends in Ithaca (January 3, 1961). Konvitz mentions that for the first time he has permitted his name to be used by a political party. While he has kept partisanship out of his classroom lectures, he comments that he told his American Ideals students that he intended to vote for Kennedy (November 3, 1960). Kallen recommended Konvitz for the position of president of the New School (October 3, 1960). Konvitz mentions that he was asked to chair a commission to be established by the American Jewish League for Israel to discuss a Zionist program for American Jews (September 28, 1960). Kallen comments on the study of science (April 21, 1959) and on Hand's lecture on the Bill of Rights (January 30, 1959). Kallen advises Konvitz not to accept the position of Dean of the Jewish Theological Seminary because he can accomplish more for the Jewish community and the American Idea by continuing his position at Cornell (June 20, 1958 and June 11, 1958). Kallen discusses the arms race and compares the conditions of the Soviet citizens with those of people in the United States (November 11, 1957). Copy of a letter from Kallen to Sidney Hook discussing in detail and at length philosophical questions in relation to the Lamont case (July 11, 1957). Copies of correspondence between Kallen and T.S.

The correspondence concerns Eliot's reaction to an address by Kallen at the National Administrative Committee of the American Jewish Congress. Eliot asks Kallen to clarify his expression "American Idea" and why he is concerned with Jewish culture and apparently not at all with Jews. Eliot also expresses his concern about Kallen's reference to a religion of America (November 26, 1954). Kallen explains his concept of the "American Idea" and culture in detail and at length (December 23, 1954). Other correspondence between Konvitz and Kallen in which the details of their daily lives, attitudes, and thoughts are exchanged. While aspects of Konvitz's work, ideas, and attitudes are expressed by himself, most of the letters are from Kallen and reflect on Konvitz and are about ?Kallen's own concerns, including such topics as world events, American Jewry, Zionism, Jewish education, the American Association for Jewish Education, the American Jewish Congress, the New School for Social Research, the policies of the New Leader, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and Communism, Sidney Hook, and philosophical and personal understandings of such experiences and concepts as death.

Correspondence with various people regarding annual solicitation among friends of Professor Horace M. Kallen for contributions to the Horace Kallen Salary Fund. Since Kallen's retirement in 1951, Konvitz annually solicited contributions from approximately 22 of Kallen's friends for funds to supplement Kallen's reduced income. Konvitz raised annually enough funds so that Kallen could continue to teach and to receive an income that was at least equal to the one he had earned prior to his retirement. Konvitz continued to raise funds for Kallen's salary through 1974, and he made certain that Kallen's wife, Rachel, would continue to receive an annual income of about half of the amount that Kallen and she had received before his death. To the best of Konvitz's knowledge, the Kallens were never made aware of his campaign to supplement their income. Correspondence regarding the Horace M. Kallen Chair at the New School for Social Research. Correspondence between Konvitz and Kallen regarding Kallen's Memorandum about "Proposed Staff Categories and Salaries" for the Jewish Teachers Seminary. Konvitz responds in detail to Kallen's proposal (May 3, 1971). Kallen's Memorandum is included (April 28, 1971).
