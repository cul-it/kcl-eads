    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>The Draper Corporation was once the largest maker of power looms for the textile industry in the United States. It operated in Hopedale, Massachusetts for more than 130 years.</p>  </bioghist>
  <scopecontent id="aspace_39ab5521fca3ebb477a86fc1ddd9e955">
    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>This collection consists of two series: Series A, 5 inch by 7 inch glass plate negatives, approximately 1,500; and Series B, 8 inch by 10 inch glass plate negatives, approximately 2,000. </p><p> Many of the photographs in Series A depict company outings, or "Field Days." These events were most likely organized by the Draper Company and may have consisted entirely of Draper Company employees. Founders of the Draper Company, brothers George and Ebenezer Draper were responsible for creating an integrated, planned community with innovative employee housing and recreational spaces, in addition to employment. </p><p> Series B consists largely of machinery built by the Draper Company. Also included are photographs of the company plant, employee housing, recreational facilities, and the surrounding area. </p><p> All negatives in this collection have been printed, please see collection 6612 P: Draper Corporation Photographs. Of the roughly 3,500 negatives 513 have been described at the individual level. Those descriptions are available in the container lists for both this collection and collection 6612 P.</p>  </scopecontent>

A dobby loom is a loom equipped with a dobby and capable of weaving small figures. The dobby is a mechanism attached to a loom for controlling the operation of the harnesses. Dobbies are made so that they can operate up to 25 harnesses and by this means figured cloths can be woven. The harness is the frame containing the heddles through which the warp threads are drawn prior to weaving. By lifting or lowering the harnesses in the loom the shed is formed. The shed is the opening formed when some warp threads are raised by their harnesses while others are left down. Forming the shed is the first action in weaving, and it is through the shed that the shuttle passes in inserting the filling. See Negative 62, in this box, for the front view of this loom and Negative 63, in this box, for what is probably the side view of this loom. The Draper Company manufactured textile machinery, primarily looms. 5 x 7 in.

May 7, 1903. Image depicts a view of the west side of Hopedale Street in Hopedale, Massachusetts, showing the Draper Company shop, office, and hose house. It is unclear which building is which, although the one-story building on the right with the striped awnings may be the office. There is a one-story wooden clapboard building with a tower in the center left; in the background are several three- and four-story brick buildings, all part of the Draper Company complex. The sign on the pole in front of the wooden clapboard building reads: "Private Property. Do No Drive In. Very Dangerous." The wooden clapboard building is at a junction of Hopedale and another street, both unpaved. A set of trolley tracks runs along Hopedale Street. A water tower is on the top of the building at the right in the background. The Draper Company manufactured textile machinery, primarily looms. See Negative 136, in this box, for a view of the buildings on the street to the left of what is shown in this image, and Box 134, Negative 165 for a view of the east side of Hopedale Street taken from behind the pole with the sign.

There is a one-story wooden clapboard building with a tower in the center; the tower is hidden behind trees. In the background are several three- and four-story brick buildings, all part of the Draper Company complex. The sign on the pole in front of the wooden clapboard building reads: "Private Property. Do No Drive In. Very Dangerous." The wooden clapboard building is at a junction of Hopedale and another street, both unpaved. A set of trolley tracks runs along Hopedale Street.

June 16, 1911. Image depicts a view of the scrap iron pile outside one of the Draper Company buildings (which are off to the right in this image). One man (who can also be seen in Negative 934, in this box) stands in front of the pile, which gives the viewer a sense of the size of the pile (at least three stories high). A group of male laborers stands on the left. A set of railroad tracks appears to run across the area, with another pile of scrap iron in the left foreground. See Negative 934 and Negative 935 for other images of the pile taken on this date. See also Box 180, Negative 883, which shows the pile two months earlier. See Box 181, Negative 896 through Negative 898 for views of this pile taken a month earlier. The Draper Company manufactured textile machinery, which explains the extent of the scrap iron pile. 8 x 10 in. See Collection 6612 P, Box 15, Folder 3, Item 937 for print of this negative.</p></scopecontent></c02><c02 id="aspace_75f9804dbd80aa1f7dae609173538416" level="file"><did><unittitle>Draper Company Exhibit, Fall River, Massachusetts, 1911</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1911/1911">1911</unitdate><container id="aspace_3bf0a4d278be3d31054ef522210d193e" label="unspecified" type="box">185</container><container id="aspace_e808ab19928ed66f62b9a98d26622e09" parent="aspace_3bf0a4d278be3d31054ef522210d193e" type="folder">942</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_0ec5bfc629208e6319c91ca54fcc55b8"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Negative no.B942.
