<p>The Draper Corporation was once the largest maker of power looms for the textile industry in the United States. It operated in Hopedale, Massachusetts for more than 130 years.</p>  </bioghist>
  <scopecontent id="aspace_39ab5521fca3ebb477a86fc1ddd9e955">
    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>This collection consists of two series: Series A, 5 inch by 7 inch glass plate negatives, approximately 1,500; and Series B, 8 inch by 10 inch glass plate negatives, approximately 2,000. </p><p> Many of the photographs in Series A depict company outings, or "Field Days." These events were most likely organized by the Draper Company and may have consisted entirely of Draper Company employees. Founders of the Draper Company, brothers George and Ebenezer Draper were responsible for creating an integrated, planned community with innovative employee housing and recreational spaces, in addition to employment. </p><p> Series B consists largely of machinery built by the Draper Company. Also included are photographs of the company plant, employee housing, recreational facilities, and the surrounding area. </p><p> All negatives in this collection have been printed, please see collection 6612 P: Draper Corporation Photographs. Of the roughly 3,500 negatives 513 have been described at the individual level. Those descriptions are available in the container lists for both this collection and collection 6612 P.</p>  </scopecontent>

Image depicts a chimney that shows damage at the top and a pile of bricks and rubble on the ground in front of it. Scaffolding around the chimney appears to be higher than the top of the chimney, which suggests that possibly something went wrong during construction, although it is possible scaffolding was erected higher than the top of the damaged chimney in order to rebuild it. A four-story brick building appears in the background. In front of that is a platform on which a number of workers can be seen. The Draper Company manufactured textile machinery, primarily looms. See Negative 1029, in this box, for a closer view of the damage at the base of the chimney and Negative 1030 and Negative 1032, also in this box, for close-up views of the interior damage.

Ballou (1803-1890) was a prominent proponent of pacifism, socialism and abolitionism, and the founder (in 1842) of the Hopedale Community, a utopian community blending a factory town with a religious-based commune. George and Ebenezer Draper withdrew their 75% of the community stock in 1856 to establish the Hopedale Manufacturing Company. Ballou continued on as Universalist pastor until retirement in 1880.

The building has two chimneys and a gabled roof with decorative ironwork running along the upper edge. There are three entrances at the front, one of which is to the post office (note the two windows labeled "Post Office") and another to the left to another business.
