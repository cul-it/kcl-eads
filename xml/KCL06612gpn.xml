    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>This collection consists of two series: Series A, 5 inch by 7 inch glass plate negatives, approximately 1,500; and Series B, 8 inch by 10 inch glass plate negatives, approximately 2,000. </p><p> Many of the photographs in Series A depict company outings, or "Field Days." These events were most likely organized by the Draper Company and may have consisted entirely of Draper Company employees. Founders of the Draper Company, brothers George and Ebenezer Draper were responsible for creating an integrated, planned community with innovative employee housing and recreational spaces, in addition to employment. </p><p> Series B consists largely of machinery built by the Draper Company. Also included are photographs of the company plant, employee housing, recreational facilities, and the surrounding area. </p><p> All negatives in this collection have been printed, please see collection 6612 P: Draper Corporation Photographs. Of the roughly 3,500 negatives 513 have been described at the individual level. Those descriptions are available in the container lists for both this collection and collection 6612 P.</p>  </scopecontent>

A dobby loom is a loom equipped with a dobby and capable of weaving small figures. The dobby is a mechanism attached to a loom for controlling the operation of the harnesses. Dobbies are made so that they can operate up to 25 harnesses and by this means figured cloths can be woven. The harness is the frame containing the heddles through which the warp threads are drawn prior to weaving. By lifting or lowering the harnesses in the loom the shed is formed. The shed is the opening formed when some warp threads are raised by their harnesses while others are left down. Forming the shed is the first action in weaving, and it is through the shed that the shuttle passes in inserting the filling. See Negative 62, in this box, for the front view of this loom and Negative 63, in this box, for what is probably the side view of this loom. The Draper Company manufactured textile machinery, primarily looms. 5 x 7 in.

Mill operatives would draw the thread through their mouths to help smooth it and make it easier to draw through the eye of the shuttle. However, sucking on cotton thread could eventually cause lung problems and did so in many mill operatives. The unidentified man wears work clothes: dark shirt and pants with a light tie. He also wears wire-rimmed glasses. The demonstration takes place in an unidentified mill; the battery of a loom can be seen on the left. He is presumably a Draper Company employee.
