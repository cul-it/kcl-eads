    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>The Draper Corporation was once the largest maker of power looms for the textile industry in the United States. It operated in Hopedale, Massachusetts for more than 130 years.</p>  </bioghist>
  <scopecontent id="aspace_39ab5521fca3ebb477a86fc1ddd9e955">
    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>This collection consists of two series: Series A, 5 inch by 7 inch glass plate negatives, approximately 1,500; and Series B, 8 inch by 10 inch glass plate negatives, approximately 2,000. </p><p> Many of the photographs in Series A depict company outings, or "Field Days." These events were most likely organized by the Draper Company and may have consisted entirely of Draper Company employees. Founders of the Draper Company, brothers George and Ebenezer Draper were responsible for creating an integrated, planned community with innovative employee housing and recreational spaces, in addition to employment. </p><p> Series B consists largely of machinery built by the Draper Company. Also included are photographs of the company plant, employee housing, recreational facilities, and the surrounding area. </p><p> All negatives in this collection have been printed, please see collection 6612 P: Draper Corporation Photographs. Of the roughly 3,500 negatives 513 have been described at the individual level. Those descriptions are available in the container lists for both this collection and collection 6612 P.</p>  </scopecontent>

Image depicts a chimney that shows damage at the top and a pile of bricks and rubble on the ground in front of it. Scaffolding around the chimney appears to be higher than the top of the chimney, which suggests that possibly something went wrong during construction, although it is possible scaffolding was erected higher than the top of the damaged chimney in order to rebuild it. A four-story brick building appears in the background. In front of that is a platform on which a number of workers can be seen. The Draper Company manufactured textile machinery, primarily looms. See Negative 1029, in this box, for a closer view of the damage at the base of the chimney and Negative 1030 and Negative 1032, also in this box, for close-up views of the interior damage.

There is a one-story wooden clapboard building with a tower in the center; the tower is hidden behind trees. In the background are several three- and four-story brick buildings, all part of the Draper Company complex. The sign on the pole in front of the wooden clapboard building reads: "Private Property. Do No Drive In. Very Dangerous." The wooden clapboard building is at a junction of Hopedale and another street, both unpaved. A set of trolley tracks runs along Hopedale Street.

A group of male laborers stands on the left. A set of railroad tracks appears to run across the area, with another pile of scrap iron in the left foreground. See Negative 934 and Negative 935 for other images of the pile taken on this date. See also Box 180, Negative 883, which shows the pile two months earlier. See Box 181, Negative 896 through Negative 898 for views of this pile taken a month earlier. The Draper Company manufactured textile machinery, which explains the extent of the scrap iron pile. 8 x 10 in.
