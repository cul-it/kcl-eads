    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>The U.S. Presidential Railroad Commission was established by Executive Order No. 10891 of November 1, 1960, to consider a controversy between carriers represented by the Eastern, Western, and Southeastern Carriers' Conference Committees and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen, the Order of Railway Conductors and Brakemen, the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, and the Switchmen's Union of North America. </p><p> Specifically, the controversy surrounded the assertion by the carriers that firemen were not needed on diesel locomotives and that their positions should be eliminated. The unions, on the other hand, maintained that modern diesel locomotives were much too complex to be operated by one engineer and that firemen were necessary to ensure safety. Seventy-nine witnesses appeared before the Commission and statements were filed on behalf of one hundred and fifty-five additional witnesses.</p><p> On February 28, 1962, the Commission filed its final report, recommending substantial changes in many of the railroad's work rules. It agreed with the carriers' position that 40,000 firemen helpers who served on freight trains were no longer needed. It also recommended that the railroads "should have an unlimited right to technological change."</p><p> See Cornell University Library's catalog entry for the final Report <extref xlink:href="https://newcatalog.library.cornell.edu/catalog/1835572">here</extref>.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>Inclusive date range: 1960-1962 </p><p> Bulk dates: 1960 </p><p> This collection consists of 1,656 images (8 film negatives and 1,648 photographs) that were taken on behalf of the railroad labor organizations to support the testimony of their members before the U.S. President's Railroad Commission regarding the crew consist dispute and their assertions regarding the necessity of the fireman position. </p><p> The railroad labor unions asked their members who worked for various carriers across the country to document their workplaces, such as train yards, stations and terminals, railroad tracks in urban and rural settings, industry sidings, industrial facilities, and locomotive engines. These photographs document the railroad facilities and equipment of 48 carriers across the United States, and were taken by more than 30 railroad employees, the majority of whom were employed as firemen and engineers. </p><p> A number of the photographs were entered into evidence by the unions, but not all of them were used in evidentiary proceedings before the Commission. Both evidentiary photographs and those not used in the proceedings are located in this collection. </p><p> The photographs are arranged into 34 Series. The series each contain photographs documenting a specific carrier in a unique location, taken by an employee or employees of that carrier on behalf of their union. Where possible, the photographs have been identifed by their exhibit number as referred to in testimony or, where that is lacking, internal numbering written on the versos of the photographs. Descriptions of the images are taken from the testimony of the photographers. For those photographs that were not included as exhibits, descriptions have been assembled from contemporaneous notes, geographical clues found in the images, and other information found in other exhibits submitted by the Organizations to the Commision.</p>  </scopecontent>

Constant lookout is imperative at all times.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_9eabab396bc9a81c2f69c017832fbdf8" level="file"><did><unittitle>Item 1: <extref xlink:actuate="onrequest" xlink:href="https://digital.library.cornell.edu/catalog/ss:20864767" linktype="simple" xlink:show="new">Click for Image</extref></unittitle><container id="aspace_1d9d0842a9e7b0b5acc7eca7a4aea714" label="unspecified" type="box">60</container><container id="aspace_a2eda37689120c0374265da352ce253a" parent="aspace_1d9d0842a9e7b0b5acc7eca7a4aea714" type="folder">19</container></did></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_704feff301c0459a66a92efefb401c38" level="file"><did><unittitle>Crest of Hump (upper and lower levels), Yard No. 5</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1960/1960">1960</unitdate><container id="aspace_5f8f03647dfb54b46d87a5f2f29f713f" label="unspecified" type="box">60</container><container id="aspace_df478aa86f67bb0364bf14f3a6d606cd" parent="aspace_5f8f03647dfb54b46d87a5f2f29f713f" type="folder">20</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_14ff33d87779a6704076522ac4f98c27"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Taken at the crest of the hump.

The boxcar in the foreground from the roof of which this picture was taken is spotted on the B &amp; O track at Robey Street, now called Damon Avenue. The curvatures on the Northwestern tracks are apparent. (This photograph was taken in the same location as Exhibit G-2 in the B&amp;O Chicago photographs by J. B. Redmond).</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_b7c69495991b3eba440c8d838655ad8d" level="file"><did><unittitle>Item 1: <extref xlink:actuate="onrequest" xlink:href="https://digital.library.cornell.edu/catalog/ss:20864889" linktype="simple" xlink:show="new">Click for Image</extref></unittitle><container id="aspace_5c2b7eef9c3cab438c49b4fe32572aad" label="unspecified" type="box">60</container><container id="aspace_fade69b868cd03f4c30d6dac5eac8694" parent="aspace_5c2b7eef9c3cab438c49b4fe32572aad" type="folder">116</container></did></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_ae51d92fb2a70b2fb79dfae74b9a1838" level="file"><did><unittitle>CNW main line approaching Kedzie Avenue Interlocking Plant</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1960/1960">1960</unitdate><container id="aspace_91b2d0ad9bdfe14ff2e04c6a73eeeded" label="unspecified" type="box">62</container><container id="aspace_9eb075f37ae15e8d708b8a82f243e614" parent="aspace_91b2d0ad9bdfe14ff2e04c6a73eeeded" type="folder">2</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_14dbeaf5e026029d700c8a183c95c711"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Shows a portion of the Kedzie Avenue interlocking plant (see Exhibit E-5 for a closer view).</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_ede4220a6aecb5716ecd648341ad7e38" level="file"><did><unittitle>Item 1: <extref xlink:actuate="onrequest" xlink:href="https://digital.library.cornell.edu/catalog/ss:20988227" linktype="simple" xlink:show="new">Click for Image</extref></unittitle><container id="aspace_9b1a5f1919ba30c99446d54791d5c561" label="unspecified" type="box">62</container><container id="aspace_06f5f9428995cd233bc66fabba208f35" parent="aspace_9b1a5f1919ba30c99446d54791d5c561" type="folder">2</container></did></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_7286dfddca9f03a9604916040d0c1419" level="file"><did><unittitle>North End of Proviso Yard No. 9</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1960/1960">1960</unitdate><container id="aspace_c76e975b28021829d4c763cbe6d58b04" label="unspecified" type="box">62</container><container id="aspace_caae007ca8dfa4a3808e6e7dbfc27f28" parent="aspace_c76e975b28021829d4c763cbe6d58b04" type="folder">3</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_f8cd0fe6abe555e7d1c5ca391763a738"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The yard has 29 tracks plus three main line tracks (Nos. 19, 20, and 30).

These photographs were submitted to the Commission as Employees' Exhibit 45, are referred to by the letter K in testimony, and were taken by Donald H. Anderson. Mr. Anderson was employed by the Chicago River and Indiana as an engineer and was a member of the BLF&amp;E. The Chicago River and Indiana operated a belt, switching, and terminal railroad in the metropolitan Chicago area serving approximately 400 industries; the railroad grew out of the need to link the Union Stockyards with the other carriers entering Chicago. The photographs in this series document the movements made by trains on this line through industries and city streets. The Chicago Hygrade Meat Packing Plant and its operations are also extensively documented, as are the surrounding streets. One picture in this series (box 56, folder 143) has been tentatively included based on the appearance that it was taken in the Union Stockyards; this identification may be incorrect.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_c5ed1835a5f5d57334a48b3da6d53f0f" level="file"><did><unittitle>Cars being shoved into warehouse</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1960/1960">1960</unitdate><container id="aspace_a3f6d05e96eada28aa67d29f01c3929b" label="unspecified" type="box">56</container><container id="aspace_4db2cd3adc64d1fa69814f8c10d860ec" parent="aspace_a3f6d05e96eada28aa67d29f01c3929b" type="folder">131</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_0da1b22742e2cb098c202d1e637d6944"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Shows cars being shoved into warehouse No. 3 at 4000 South Wallace Street.

These photographs were not submitted to the Commission and as such do not have identifying exhibit numbers. These photographs document railroad facilities in and around Denver, Colorado. This includes industries around Cherry Creek, the Rio Grande's Car Shops and Freight Yards, AT&amp;SF Yards, Denver Union Station and its passenger Yards, and grade crossings in industrial areas. Because these photographs were not used before the Commission, there is limited descriptive data for some of the images. As the Burnham Shops and Yards were the hub of the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad, it is likely that these photographs were taken by one of its employees.

These photographs were not submitted to the Commission and as such do not have identifying exhibit numbers. The Duluth, Missabe and Iron Range Railway is a railroad operating in northern Minnesota and Wisconsin that hauled iron ore and later taconite to the Great Lakes ports of Duluth and Two Harbors, Minnesota. The photographs document the trackage, viaducts, ore docks, ships, coal yards, and carrier facilities as well as extensive documentation from inside the locomotive cab of a DM&amp;IR train hauling coal hoppers. The viaducts and ore docks are located in either Duluth or Two Harbors, Minnesota The train yards are most likely in Proctor, Minnesota; other locations are unidentified. Because these photographs were not used before the Commission, there is limited descriptive data for some of the images.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_1db2b4bcb1f98aa76f62f266f4e5484e"

Washington</unittitle></did><scopecontent id="aspace_50c54b85648e798d8e33279cd94cd856"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This series consists of photographs of the Great Northern Railway's facilities in Everett and Seattle, Washington. These photographs were submitted to the Commission as Employees' Exhibit 23, are referred to by the letter J in testimony, and were taken by V.S. "Bud" Zumwinkle. Mr. Zumwinkle was employed as an engineer in both road and yard service for the Great Northern and was local chairman of Lodge 501 of the BLF&amp;E. The Great Northern Railway was a class I railroad, operating from Saint Paul, Minnesota, to Seattle, Washington. The Great Northern's (GN) route was the northernmost transcontinental railroad route in the United States. The photographs in this series depict the GN's facilities in Seattle and Everett, Washington as a well as trackage in downtown Seattle used by the GN and other carriers such as the Milwaukee Road. Also depicted in this series are numerous industries, including the Scott Paper Mill and Washington Iron Works. Included in this series are six photographs of GN locomotives 159 and 220; their inclusion in this series is a tentative identification, and these photographs might have been taken in another location.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_0817dc78381c00a23cb2fe0c077387c8" level="file"><did><unittitle>Great Northern Railroad Locomotive 220</unittitle><container id="aspace_87c5e37357410d6aca8c350a847b0e71" label="unspecified" type="box">53</container><container id="aspace_d071dfafc51037ab9ca8c1ef7177062c" parent="aspace_87c5e37357410d6aca8c350a847b0e71" type="folder">121</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_1e00ce9703255f7444880ee82dc68439"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>GN Unit #220.

There are typically two (sometimes three or four) crews working in this area.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_6fff955f06bfcf2daea066710b4aaf3a" level="file"><did><unittitle>Item 1: <extref xlink:actuate="onrequest" xlink:href="https://digital.library.cornell.edu/catalog/ss:20863479" linktype="simple" xlink:show="new">Click for Image</extref></unittitle><container id="aspace_518582497e4fc56fb61b9d22e81bb0e0" label="unspecified" type="box">59</container><container id="aspace_d88ee69fef259eeeb1d3c55df42c7eef" parent="aspace_518582497e4fc56fb61b9d22e81bb0e0" type="folder">31</container></did></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_2738e7c032958fc247891081859d65ac" level="file"><did><unittitle>South End of Interbay Yard</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1960/1960">1960</unitdate><container id="aspace_1952e6cfd51ba40a067fdd5a5ab3282f" label="unspecified" type="box">59</container><container id="aspace_18fbeb44964f49abdc780f45ef450b46" parent="aspace_1952e6cfd51ba40a067fdd5a5ab3282f" type="folder">32</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_be93b23c8a73cedf9ebd3436d18e39ba"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Looking north, showing curvature of track, and crossover between No. 12 and No. 13 tracks.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_e55d64147911adf260f814bb07ef725b" level="file"><did><unittitle>Item 1: <extref xlink:actuate="onrequest" xlink:href="https://digital.library.cornell.edu/catalog/ss:20863480" linktype="simple" xlink:show="new">Click for Image</extref></unittitle><container id="aspace_e8133d0c0a398b142addeb5e56983672" label="unspecified" type="box">59</container><container id="aspace_675b377afa235bbe788c02b0a51e611d" parent="aspace_e8133d0c0a398b142addeb5e56983672" type="folder">32</container></did></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_5481376030603a58c68b5840a50f600a" level="file"><did><unittitle>South End of Interbay Yard</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1960/1960">1960</unitdate><container id="aspace_b5cc23ac2a6601c2152aeb54197ec240" label="unspecified" type="box">59</container><container id="aspace_1f953fda9793baafebe0e9ebf2f270bb" parent="aspace_b5cc23ac2a6601c2152aeb54197ec240" type="folder">33</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_de3cc3ddda7d03fce2ea03de7e2d152f"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Photograph taken from Dravus Street Bridge.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_09d74aa36691daeb840ed4c0dbbc29b3" level="file"><did><unittitle>Item 1: <extref xlink:actuate="onrequest" xlink:href="https://digital.library.cornell.edu/catalog/ss:20863481" linktype="simple" xlink:show="new">Click for Image</extref></unittitle><container id="aspace_a3b0d237b97d9e7e988db1f61404058f" label="unspecified" type="box">59</container><container id="aspace_e084ce2be814ccf7801a9904b71a8a7a" parent="aspace_a3b0d237b97d9e7e988db1f61404058f" type="folder">33</container></did></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_b5346d113a115fd8ad00ec188647f842" level="file"><did><unittitle>Center of Interbay Yard</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1960/1960">1960</unitdate><container id="aspace_557b4056e9823a94a4c8948d0c9fff64" label="unspecified" type="box">59</container><container id="aspace_dce6bfd8d550cb027a32fbd9193545ed" parent="aspace_557b4056e9823a94a4c8948d0c9fff64" type="folder">34</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_1c90f635fcd60fbc1f068ecb9597aa44"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Taken from the Dravus Bridge, which is located midway between the north and south end of the yard.

To the right of the picture is the roundhouse and the main line. All the tracks in this area, excepting the rip (repair) tracks, have the same marked degree of curvature. The rip tracks are in the extreme upper left-hand portion of the picture and are comparatively straight. The curvatures of the tracks again make it necessary for firemen to maintain a lookout from their side of the cab. The engines that work the lead in the north end of the yard are headed south, so the signals are mostly passed on the engineer's side because the curve is on his side. The extreme right track goes into three Western Food Express tracks, and curves in both directions, so the signals are given on either side of the locomotive. Also, the old main line and Government Tracks Nos. 1, 2, and 3 are also in this area and curve in both directions. (This is a zoomed out print of the negatived used to print the other J-34, internal number #27.)</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_905fe85f94dc5aaf3fc250fdb57ad675" level="file"><did><unittitle>Item 1: <extref xlink:actuate="onrequest" xlink:href="https://digital.library.cornell.edu/catalog/ss:20864726" linktype="simple" xlink:show="new">Click for Image</extref></unittitle><container id="aspace_9b2867871d5f9fa970b16eaa99aea18b" label="unspecified" type="box">59</container><container id="aspace_db9e6482d0ed9c35f5f3e7ac61329783" parent="aspace_9b2867871d5f9fa970b16eaa99aea18b" type="folder">131</container></did></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_b268073080853dc5355fa3088bf0317b" level="file"><did><unittitle>South End of Interbay Yard</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1960/1960">1960</unitdate><container id="aspace_42a5c54eb3d0ca21f0145e9a65250a76" label="unspecified" type="box">60</container><container id="aspace_f14e9a2a7033733745f0161ea2fb0527" parent="aspace_42a5c54eb3d0ca21f0145e9a65250a76" type="folder">36</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_c1eeb93929d7e1e9c709451f00672375"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Note tracks curve sharply to the left coming onto the lead, which makes the curve to the fireman's side, engines are headed south (photograph taken facing north).

Tracks are referred to as Seventh Avenue. Great Northern trains must move over Northern Pacific and Milwaukee Road main lines. Engines are generally headed north in this area. Because of the close clearance it is also necessary sometimes to pass signals on the fireman's side. Note also the curvature of the tracks. The street crossing is not readily seen, but is used extensively. There is also a great deal of industrial work that goes on in this area.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_8c02c09d29bc10000f307cd534ba8d38" level="file"><did><unittitle>Item 1: <extref xlink:actuate="onrequest" xlink:href="https://digital.library.cornell.edu/catalog/ss:20988360" linktype="simple" xlink:show="new">Click for Image</extref></unittitle><container id="aspace_5d22e95cdcb5934a9e5774ba92d9f0e9" label="unspecified" type="box">63</container><container id="aspace_338b89e4b918780b94e008a161a0fa40" parent="aspace_5d22e95cdcb5934a9e5774ba92d9f0e9" type="folder">18</container></did></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_ce0fec2b44fbb081dd1fcc2492bd2816" level="file"><did><unittitle>Freight Cars on Tracks</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1960/1960">1960</unitdate><container id="aspace_74d48265550cff5eca3a9fcbd770df92" label="unspecified" type="box">63</container><container id="aspace_8eb5a711126d989c5af09511ac222b37" parent="aspace_74d48265550cff5eca3a9fcbd770df92" type="folder">19</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_d9af4d79bf9c8d99cdffa2f36fa7c835"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Northbound extra freight, Seattle to Everett; taken at Golden Gardens.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_fb58219309c65cf28cba683029bbe964" level="file"><did><unittitle>Item 1: <extref xlink:actuate="onrequest" xlink:href="https://digital.library.cornell.edu/catalog/ss:20988361" linktype="simple" xlink:show="new">Click for Image</extref></unittitle><container id="aspace_c819deb3a32f89fa49949c0f2121868a" label="unspecified" type="box">63</container><container id="aspace_dd98119f7f54cb221991bec684664dff" parent="aspace_c819deb3a32f89fa49949c0f2121868a" type="folder">19</container></did></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_7c8051c9d02d020a90593acc71d604c8" level="file"><did><unittitle>Freight Cars on Track</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1960/1960">1960</unitdate><container id="aspace_ffcd11b6f71b017d76c388237109071b" label="unspecified" type="box">63</container><container id="aspace_eebca2408381a76cb285e5eb1b4cd4f1" parent="aspace_ffcd11b6f71b017d76c388237109071b" type="folder">20</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_0a88e0c59ac0dfa15cd14839da46f27f"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Northbound extra freight, Seattle to Everett; taken at Golden Gardens.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_a78a03e59916eeb870de2a65342bfffc" level="file"><did><unittitle>Item 1: <extref xlink:actuate="onrequest" xlink:href="https://digital.library.cornell.edu/catalog/ss:20988362" linktype="simple" xlink:show="new">Click for Image</extref></unittitle><container id="aspace_4f50af7418c50f2c7c05fa3f6d8bde4b" label="unspecified" type="box">63</container><container id="aspace_2c49e09d1d7ea9fb64086278703454ae" parent="aspace_4f50af7418c50f2c7c05fa3f6d8bde4b" type="folder">20</container></did></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_75dd72f4a9c5d9f437c4659271b3f716" level="file"><did><unittitle>North End of New Yard (Bayside Yard)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1960/1960">1960</unitdate><container id="aspace_d425dd5c8e4b27b090275a240b4f6563" label="unspecified" type="box">63</container><container id="aspace_d3fe540fd1d955a01e672fecc7360f42" parent="aspace_d425dd5c8e4b27b090275a240b4f6563" type="folder">21</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_a054dc5e8c0cd233b2c8d2ef0b058ebc"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Looking south from fire station toward Yard Office; main line to left.

This is a 24/7 operation.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_32c243a9e217071513e041dbb6c2bfa6" level="file"><did><unittitle>Item 1: <extref xlink:actuate="onrequest" xlink:href="https://digital.library.cornell.edu/catalog/ss:20988383" linktype="simple" xlink:show="new">Click for Image</extref></unittitle><container id="aspace_fa0b6fbf22ab0ecd33db27be12ce77ee" label="unspecified" type="box">63</container><container id="aspace_77f55143280fde339ea29b189957281c" parent="aspace_fa0b6fbf22ab0ecd33db27be12ce77ee" type="folder">41</container></did></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_5bb82b189c8b58b4062570da1d6eea97" level="file"><did><unittitle>Center of Interbay Yard</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1960/1960">1960</unitdate><container id="aspace_e898b0abedfac77902822768c2c447d9" label="unspecified" type="box">63</container><container id="aspace_39973b489f4c07dffbfaeb94a5fe123c" parent="aspace_e898b0abedfac77902822768c2c447d9" type="folder">42</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_56b836d06837410dec04a9af66805db4"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>GN Engine 278-A (EMD FA2 A&amp;B Unit) northbound on main line.

To the right of the picture is the roundhouse and the main line. All the tracks in this area, excepting the rip (repair) tracks, have the same marked degree of curvature. The rip tracks are in the extreme upper left-hand portion of the picture and are comparatively straight. The curvatures of the tracks again make it necessary for firemen to maintain a lookout from their side of the cab. The engines that work the lead in the north end of the yard are headed south, so the signals are mostly passed on the engineer's side because the curve is on his side. The extreme right track goes into three Western Food Express tracks, and curves in both directions, so the signals are given on either side of the locomotive. Also, the old main line and Government Tracks Nos. 1, 2, and 3 are also in this area and curve in both directions. (This is a zoomed out print of the negatived used to print the other J-34, internal number #27.)</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_462d3cec679bfc602a292b83b8e8c3a8" level="file"><did><unittitle>Item 1: <extref xlink:actuate="onrequest" xlink:href="https://digital.library.cornell.edu/catalog/ss:20988385" linktype="simple" xlink:show="new">Click for Image</extref></unittitle><container id="aspace_68a09232bf49ad8d7e3a4cdb5c24889c" label="unspecified" type="box">63</container><container id="aspace_0ae9eefa67b767b8cd8fbf3ba76236a2" parent="aspace_68a09232bf49ad8d7e3a4cdb5c24889c" type="folder">43</container></did></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_702e091d6f469bf2a9cf56e74deb28fd" level="file"><did><unittitle>South End of Interbay Yard</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1960/1960">1960</unitdate><container id="aspace_91685b9fecf11696c836126533dcd14a" label="unspecified" type="box">63</container><container id="aspace_d41ebbf6dbc195f828e7e89f564b7e5a" parent="aspace_91685b9fecf11696c836126533dcd14a" type="folder">44</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_bb0ef5cfa5cbe4f3b1d71ba37ef7a0f4"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Note tracks curve sharply to the left coming onto the lead, which makes the curve to the fireman's side, engines are headed south (photograph taken facing north).

These photographs were submitted to the Commission as Employees' Exhibit 19, are referred to by the letter L in testimony, and were taken by Arnold M. Strommen. Mr. Strommen was employed as a locomotive engineer for the Great Northern in the Willmar, Minnesota Seniority District and was local chairman of Lodge 95 of the BLF&amp;E. These photographs were taken on October 31, 1960, when Mr. Strommen worked on through freight service between Willmar and Minneapolis, Minnesota. The Great Northern Railway was a class I railroad, operating from Saint Paul, Minnesota, to Seattle, Washington. The Great Northern's (GN) route was the northernmost transcontinental railroad route in the United States. The photographs in this series depict the GN's facilities in Minnesota, including the union yards at Minneapolis Junction and the industries served by the GN, including various grain elevators.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_a812898eba3db9997bdfe22cc7d73a5c" level="file"><did><unittitle>Freight Yard</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1960/1960">1960</unitdate><container id="aspace_c771f1c80c17c798d5e164b11b95735b" label="unspecified" type="box">53</container><container id="aspace_4bc8209d326721927a659cd243e51222" parent="aspace_c771f1c80c17c798d5e164b11b95735b" type="folder">190</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_06bf9621037238ab8c533f142b405f06"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Shows how the tracks converge at this junction.

These photographs were submitted to the Commission as Employees' Exhibit 47, are referred to by the letter N in testimony, and were taken by Fred Howell. Mr. Howell was employed as an engineer and fireman by the Illinois Central in their Memphis Division and was a member of the BLF&amp;E. The Illinois Central was a class I railroad in the central United States, with its primary routes connecting Chicago, Illinois, with New Orleans, Louisiana, and Mobile, Alabama. Branch lines to the west connected Chicago with Sioux City, Iowa, and Omaha, Nebraska. The photographs in this series depict the IC's facilities and industries served in Memphis, Tennessee; Helena, Arkansas; and Clarksdale, Mississippi, including the docks on the Mississippi River where freight cars were loaded onto steamboats for transfer between Mississippi and Arkansas.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_a2b0bf35f4b4e430de8be94993eec503" level="file"><did><unittitle>Classification Yard and Diesel Shop</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1960/1960">1960</unitdate><container id="aspace_d08d9d4c1d0bf6e11eb0a0a8c0d5365c" label="unspecified" type="box">56</container><container id="aspace_4f09a8d4cda509b43858cfa51864608e" parent="aspace_d08d9d4c1d0bf6e11eb0a0a8c0d5365c" type="folder">2</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_1129087674305330d6f7ba3d816186f1"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Shows part of the Memphis terminal.

This is the main line looking south when entering Central Station, which has "S" curve. The shanty is at Hulen street where a switch tender was employed, but who has been eliminated. This is a good view showing how the lead crosses the main line to gain access to the "new track." The fireman here is responsible for passing signals and for watching cross-overs and road crossings.

As you can see, buildings obstruct vision and there are a great number of turn-outs and cross-overs here. See particularly how the trucks block the tracks. As you can see in the center rear, a large truck is actually blocking one of the tracks. Naturally, under these conditions a fireman must keep particularly close watch. This shows also weeds and debris along the tracks. In fact it is so bad that in some places it is difficult to see the track.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_c8fdae6006d0676aa82e68070c516d6a" level="file"><did><unittitle>Item 1: <extref xlink:actuate="onrequest" xlink:href="https://digital.library.cornell.edu/catalog/ss:20433816" linktype="simple" xlink:show="new">Click for Image</extref></unittitle><container id="aspace_4eb06eb09c49f4aad88fc6bff071ea2d" label="unspecified" type="box">56</container><container id="aspace_60d04a7406c4547fb6d65e3b5efaa354" parent="aspace_4eb06eb09c49f4aad88fc6bff071ea2d" type="folder">9</container></did></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_5bac1ef6c31cd13322200a208463b0b9" level="file"><did><unittitle>Industrial Siding</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1960/1960">1960</unitdate><container id="aspace_d9631baac220394e2992fe61d22f77fc" label="unspecified" type="box">56</container><container id="aspace_2d1ade13a7de0d54028de5d5699dbad6" parent="aspace_d9631baac220394e2992fe61d22f77fc" type="folder">10</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_5a84c31bf4a083496ffdbd2c226f3c59"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Illustrates poor housekeeping. Notice how the weeds along the right-of-way obscure the rail and also obscure anything that may be along the track. Clearances are very close. The tracks are blocked by automobile and truck traffic as you can see from the picture. Notice the truck parked on the tracks in the center rear of the picture. Notice also the very close clearance between the truck shown in the far left and the box car shown to its right. Notice also this is quite a hilly area and therefore it's necessary for the box cars to have the brakes set. These tracks are on Tennessee Street in the terminal. They run right in the middle of a public street for half a mile, around a curve in the street. First-class freight trains travel this route, as well as switch engines, with numerous industries, all of which are protected by the fireman, whose responsibilities include taking all the signals in spotting cars, protecting the property of the railroad and the public alike.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_37570193ecf3827db57123a485647d9e" level="file"><did><unittitle>Item 1: <extref xlink:actuate="onrequest" xlink:href="https://digital.library.cornell.edu/catalog/ss:20433817" linktype="simple" xlink:show="new">Click for Image</extref></unittitle><container id="aspace_e82b16b08811ed96ed9072cec9e8b644" label="unspecified" type="box">56</container><container id="aspace_34bdbc22dec42c67f654cf887578033f" parent="aspace_e82b16b08811ed96ed9072cec9e8b644" type="folder">10</container></did></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_461197f417edce891de59f1d1f197726" level="file"><did><unittitle>Freight Cars</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1960/1960">1960</unitdate><container id="aspace_af500e2eb4bfb5cda06d7fcf1e35b20f" label="unspecified" type="box">56</container><container id="aspace_7e5cb32be3f06f878cbc9df25cde64c3" parent="aspace_af500e2eb4bfb5cda06d7fcf1e35b20f" type="folder">11</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_3f2f36495103f942e3861c250f42aae2"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>We see a picture of the Memphis Terminal.

This wye is used to go east on Broadway (Railroad) Avenue while making transfer delivery to foreign railroads. Approximately 1/2 mile of this track on Broadway is interlocking plant. The remaining track, traveling through the heart of Memphis, over public crossings and crossing two main lines of foreign railroads, is approximately five miles in length. Track leading from center to left is known as Frisco Wye. This wye crosses at approximately 60 degrees angles the Frisco, Missouri Pacific, and Rock Island Main Lines, that are visible only from the fireman's side. The three main lines mentioned above are arranged so that there is a sharp curve after leaving the bridge that spans the Mississippi River. Crews using this track can only see approximately one city block, which is hardly enough visibility for such a congested area (in use by six class-1 railroads with train consists of as many as six diesel units and 150 to 225 cars).</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_38260ecbd23568b486998ecfc3b62e2f" level="file"><did><unittitle>Item 1: <extref xlink:actuate="onrequest" xlink:href="https://digital.library.cornell.edu/catalog/ss:20433833" linktype="simple" xlink:show="new">Click for Image</extref></unittitle><container id="aspace_3a2b1e47cc7eb82f81a768e74f4905d8" label="unspecified" type="box">56</container><container id="aspace_c1cc47fd02772f69bfce19db3ce2bbd0" parent="aspace_3a2b1e47cc7eb82f81a768e74f4905d8" type="folder">26</container></did></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_fe3e27c8983c76c8b8937df12b6de2f8" level="file"><did><unittitle>Kimberly Clark Building, North Memphis</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1960/1960">1960</unitdate><container id="aspace_1fecd1aa6c0684f6b0763dd891124e94" label="unspecified" type="box">56</container><container id="aspace_8f29137fb0235971fbe7178ccc0b683b" parent="aspace_1fecd1aa6c0684f6b0763dd891124e94" type="folder">27</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_66a862cfab6c9eeae92cf04dccf9b24c"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Shows cars being spotted in the Kimberly Clark building with the fireman receiving signals.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_c352e66b2544e6b52fe014cb6f0ff6f0" level="file"><did><unittitle>Item 1: <extref xlink:actuate="onrequest" xlink:href="https://digital.library.cornell.edu/catalog/ss:20433834" linktype="simple" xlink:show="new">Click for Image</extref></unittitle><container id="aspace_eaef87f69c7be2092872973587034294" label="unspecified" type="box">56</container><container id="aspace_34c2219026b3d3712e7a6590225ed6d5" parent="aspace_eaef87f69c7be2092872973587034294" type="folder">27</container></did></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_5245a8f31e7457a99b513cca38d21d7d" level="file"><did><unittitle>Industrial Siding</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1960/1960">1960</unitdate><container id="aspace_5e530bef1ce7d0f5f718d165edbf6d2b" label="unspecified" type="box">56</container><container id="aspace_9fc23a6b991705f117babfd3db3348ae" parent="aspace_5e530bef1ce7d0f5f718d165edbf6d2b" type="folder">28</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_3796d9a1d8a67ffeddac39af3b33ff9e"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Taken in the Memphis terminal.

This creates a bad condition for any one who is compelled to jump on and off moving cars and demands special vigilance on the part of the fireman. Notice also how the road runs right along by the track. You can see several points at which the tracks cross over the road. These crossings are not protected in any way. The driver of automobiles know that there are railroad tracks and railroad trains here, but cars seldom hesitate to look to see whether there are any trains coming. Moreover, the clearances are very close. not more than two or three feet, as you can see from the picture. A trainman riding on a car has to be observed carefully by all employees to ensure safe operation.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_3b51b236f5a13cb65a8d164496a7b8d9" level="file"><did><unittitle>Item 1: <extref xlink:actuate="onrequest" xlink:href="https://digital.library.cornell.edu/catalog/ss:20433840" linktype="simple" xlink:show="new">Click for Image</extref></unittitle><container id="aspace_ea66ab175b77d589e0c2b964227176b1" label="unspecified" type="box">56</container><container id="aspace_cf69c2ebcd5f4fe9f707e87f82a43c2d" parent="aspace_ea66ab175b77d589e0c2b964227176b1" type="folder">33</container></did></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_363c924b1443c0c192638b17bcf9ebf7" level="file"><did><unittitle>Southern Wye (center) and Frisco Wye (on left)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1960/1960">1960</unitdate><container id="aspace_e6dbf7dcdafea9bb11c39f39e6563069" label="unspecified" type="box">56</container><container id="aspace_c537075c932205cc5e08105eebfbfb2a" parent="aspace_e6dbf7dcdafea9bb11c39f39e6563069" type="folder">34</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_6b7a185fe860258e2527e2f39177eb62"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Illinois Central passenger car to right in photo (cannot be certain of identification). (Same as photographs Internal Nos. 14, 17, and 23) The sharp curve in the center to the right of the picture is known as Southern Wye. This wye is used to go east on Broadway (Railroad) Avenue while making transfer delivery to foreign railroads. Approximately 1/2 mile of this track on Broadway is interlocking plant. The remaining track, traveling through the heart of Memphis, over public crossings and crossing two main lines of foreign railroads, is approximately five miles in length. Track leading from center to left is known as Frisco Wye. This wye crosses at approximately 60 degrees angles the Frisco, Missouri Pacific, and Rock Island Main Lines, that are visible only from the fireman's side. The three main lines mentioned above are arranged so that there is a sharp curve after leaving the bridge that spans the Mississippi River. Crews using this track can only see approximately one city block, which is hardly enough visibility for such a congested area (in use by six class-1 railroads with train consists of as many as six diesel units and 150 to 225 cars).</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_287c694510fc81c2cef726a86e4173f4" level="file"><did><unittitle>Item 1: <extref xlink:actuate="onrequest" xlink:href="https://digital.library.cornell.edu/catalog/ss:20433841" linktype="simple" xlink:show="new">Click for Image</extref></unittitle><container id="aspace_76d1e3f6e8509d3e111179ddf0ffee40" label="unspecified" type="box">56</container><container id="aspace_56feaede7ae4970c1bab32a6ed94ef36" parent="aspace_76d1e3f6e8509d3e111179ddf0ffee40" type="folder">34</container></did></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_2aba039531681e72f8554fcf59bcc2df" level="file"><did><unittitle>Blind Crossing</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1960/1960">1960</unitdate><container id="aspace_1583f25012397b2147b1279bf71618de" label="unspecified" type="box">56</container><container id="aspace_5ce68c1dc1c621aef9966c37f09dfbdd" parent="aspace_1583f25012397b2147b1279bf71618de" type="folder">35</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_5fb2e4c192f778afe7fbfbf7ffe311f8"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>In the Memphis terminal.

Note also the houses close to the track which of course poses the hazard of children running out from the houses onto the track. You notice that there are no fences along the right-of-way to keep off children. Notice also on right side of picture the footpath for pedestrians.

One crossing is used a great deal, and, as the picture shows, the view of the locomotive coming out of this spur track is blocked by the two buildings shown in the picture, one on each side of the track.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_aa7508a5c2199ebc8bfa0bc62d3003cf" level="file"><did><unittitle>Item 1: <extref xlink:actuate="onrequest" xlink:href="https://digital.library.cornell.edu/catalog/ss:20433850" linktype="simple" xlink:show="new">Click for Image</extref></unittitle><container id="aspace_969707f8898852d0ca9d685abdac2e53" label="unspecified" type="box">56</container><container id="aspace_b77f92523982f02efaecc87527150e17" parent="aspace_969707f8898852d0ca9d685abdac2e53" type="folder">44</container></did></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_f34037d41e768985c8195637986f94d0" level="file"><did><unittitle>Track Leading to River</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1960/1960">1960</unitdate><container id="aspace_294f5687c8bbc357c01c26e4a2ff806a" label="unspecified" type="box">56</container><container id="aspace_7cf75081726d80339dc01953474dc96f" parent="aspace_294f5687c8bbc357c01c26e4a2ff806a" type="folder">45</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_eda9be6b80390501f0797ebc12d7af8e"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Ferry operation between Trotters Point, MS and Helena, AK.

The concrete retaining wall shown on the left side of the picture and the concrete wall shown on the right side of the picture both cut down visibility and make it essential to have a look-out on both sides of the locomotive. You will notice a footpath in the middle of the track that leads from incline to the sea wall. This is used by pedestrians going to and from the river. Because the sea wall blocks the view of both pedestrians and the engine crew it is most important to keep close observation in order to prevent injury to pedestrians in this area. Float operations are carried out across the Mississippi River in all kinds of weather. Vision is often times obstructed by dense fog.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_d56f7adc8b0ce2102f69b9d28df254c9" level="file"><did><unittitle>Item 1: <extref xlink:actuate="onrequest" xlink:href="https://digital.library.cornell.edu/catalog/ss:20433858" linktype="simple" xlink:show="new">Click for Image</extref></unittitle><container id="aspace_f96021b2803c70500eae84bc0d8134cd" label="unspecified" type="box">56</container><container id="aspace_a92c278654436837b4548cc4ef0d8a98" parent="aspace_f96021b2803c70500eae84bc0d8134cd" type="folder">52</container></did></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_8cbef5eedcfc4e027948eb8ec4e44d97" level="file"><did><unittitle>Tracks Leading to Mississippi River</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1960/1960">1960</unitdate><container id="aspace_d0a456758d0ba213764d04872f8259e6" label="unspecified" type="box">56</container><container id="aspace_e9128f2a035716c3a663d63588697660" parent="aspace_d0a456758d0ba213764d04872f8259e6" type="folder">53</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_24c00b6da797eb94dec190be695e9455"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Car float in picture. Unit No. 609. Shows the ferry operation between Trotters Point, Mississippi, and Helena, Arkansas. This is a picture taken on the Trotters Point side of the Mississippi River. This photograph shows a locomotive backing a car on a long incline toward the ferry which is shown just pulling up toward the shore. This operation is extremely hazardous and requires great alertness on the part of both the fireman and the engineer. As you can see from the picture it is obviously essential for the locomotive to push the car being loaded on the ferry. From eight to twelve cards are loaded on the ferry, the exact number depending upon the type of car being loaded. The engine is placed on the boat when transferring cards from the Mississippi side to the Arkansas side and on the return trip. On account of two tracks on the boat the engine has to shove the cars on the boat in order to put cars on both tracks. This operation actually cuts off the view of the engineer because his view is restricted not only by the locomotive but also by the cars which he is pushing. Moreover, there is the problem that loading the cars on the ferry has to be done very carefully and very precisely, because there is always a certain amount of movement of the ferry due to current on the river while the cars are being loaded. Naturally the same considerations apply where the cars are being pulled off the ferry.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_678cfa7f8e20c8e96595f41ebade90c8" level="file"><did><unittitle>Item 1: <extref xlink:actuate="onrequest" xlink:href="https://digital.library.cornell.edu/catalog/ss:20433859" linktype="simple" xlink:show="new">Click for Image</extref></unittitle><container id="aspace_07748906959eef9bb090a2c3919ecf59" label="unspecified" type="box">56</container><container id="aspace_30058fc0035111ca42734cde71b713db" parent="aspace_07748906959eef9bb090a2c3919ecf59" type="folder">53</container></did></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_c35c6bef6b453eb4297d2c13bb27f88c" level="file"><did><unittitle>Tracks Leading to River</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1960/1960">1960</unitdate><container id="aspace_a04139272790c26e1315935b67866585" label="unspecified" type="box">56</container><container id="aspace_18fbe27ccb3999f92ad82269c0904f8c" parent="aspace_a04139272790c26e1315935b67866585" type="folder">54</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_da616145326a8faca9988ab76969d1b4"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Shows the locomotive just starting down the long incline to the float.

Long Island City and Hudson River Railyards</unittitle></did><scopecontent id="aspace_6cb74aa1470777873970690e37b69753"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This series consists of photographs of facilities in and around New York City. These photographs were submitted to the Commission as Employees' Exhibit 7, are referred to by the letters AA in testimony, and were taken by H.H. Franklin. Mr. Franklin worked as an engineer on passenger trains for the LIRR and was the general chairman of the BLF&amp;E on that railroad. The LIRR is a railroad located on Long Island in New York State. Established in 1834 and having operated continuously since then, it is the second-oldest U.S. railroad still operating under its original name and charter. The LIRR is the busiest commuter railroad in the United States, and also operates a large amount of freight service. At the time these photographs were taken, the LIRR operated its passenger service with both diesel and multiple unit electric engines while the freight service was operated exclusively with diesel engines. The photographs in this series document operations at the LIRR's facilities in Long Island City, Queens, New York. This includes both the train yards and the car floats on the east River. Also included in this series are four photographs of New York Central operations at the Hudson River Railyards. These photographs have been included in this series because of geographic proximity, but their identification as part of this group of photographs is tentative.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_9ba72a122b34e81b7b5c834c3b2742f0" level="file"><did><unittitle>Car Float on Apron, Hudson River</unittitle><container id="aspace_452e4255001ef665796b3b36f7e022c0" label="unspecified" type="box">62</container><container id="aspace_d755a1720f8c33bbe6673a8dbeb215b2" parent="aspace_452e4255001ef665796b3b36f7e022c0" type="folder">101</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_3431d8f24232cbc55860fc69e3356994"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Across river is Hoboken, New Jersey.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_8bcad93dd4045a7883707b4d0ab78926" level="file"><did><unittitle>Item 1: <extref xlink:actuate="onrequest" xlink:href="https://digital.library.cornell.edu/catalog/ss:20988326" linktype="simple" xlink:show="new">Click for Image</extref></unittitle><container id="aspace_d9a463f372e5854ed3b24accd18d9be4" label="unspecified" type="box">62</container><container id="aspace_70cfbcb2737ccf4f4a16101d79fcf76b" parent="aspace_d9a463f372e5854ed3b24accd18d9be4" type="folder">101</container></did></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_90e931bc58b0f93dd3dc0044a00dc74f" level="file"><did><unittitle>View from Fireman's Side of Cab</unittitle><container id="aspace_4f663930648a9a20d7fb839d33f2d767" label="unspecified" type="box">62</container><container id="aspace_a77e5b48315880619553317ad476e0dd" parent="aspace_4f663930648a9a20d7fb839d33f2d767" type="folder">102</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_861e72cde10fcf206223c9aa47951bb8"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Grade crossing coming out of Hudson River Rail Yards.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_207cc32843f5891a85349681808c5330" level="file"><did><unittitle>Item 1: <extref xlink:actuate="onrequest" xlink:href="https://digital.library.cornell.edu/catalog/ss:20988327" linktype="simple" xlink:show="new">Click for Image</extref></unittitle><container id="aspace_0044b71f5561d56646d0ec92b7dd5eaa" label="unspecified" type="box">62</container><container id="aspace_576fe7e3a77b6a16741aae3c44b48b3f" parent="aspace_0044b71f5561d56646d0ec92b7dd5eaa" type="folder">102</container></did></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_3f18fa9c2e5332d704e0d01aa5572263" level="file"><did><unittitle>View from Engineer's Side of Cab</unittitle><container id="aspace_84eec41f7d4a39ce2b5d1ce74d65b166" label="unspecified" type="box">62</container><container id="aspace_c16a09787805d40ce67b841e56d00660" parent="aspace_84eec41f7d4a39ce2b5d1ce74d65b166" type="folder">103</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_71723c48a46bc7ae1efff2a744a0f6e2"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Grade crossing coming out of Hudson River Rail Yards.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_afe97448a234832347dfb284bf56e5fe" level="file"><did><unittitle>Item 1: <extref xlink:actuate="onrequest" xlink:href="https://digital.library.cornell.edu/catalog/ss:20988328" linktype="simple" xlink:show="new">Click for Image</extref></unittitle><container id="aspace_aa1abe22c732e30996b0680356b19cd0" label="unspecified" type="box">62</container><container id="aspace_10b23e45d66a1473673a5db0e021bed7" parent="aspace_aa1abe22c732e30996b0680356b19cd0" type="folder">103</container></did></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_b475f611e7ec0f19f419b3040262aa44" level="file"><did><unittitle>NYC Unit 357</unittitle><container id="aspace_16c5b4bf43313fbd91874b07d1b8d239" label="unspecified" type="box">62</container><container id="aspace_396e9fef02c92e79c249aa54e3b0d1b9" parent="aspace_16c5b4bf43313fbd91874b07d1b8d239" type="folder">104</container></did><c03 id="aspace_645780cdd61bd121f5bc79d9e6fc3573" level="file"><did><unittitle>Item 1: <extref xlink:actuate="onrequest" xlink:href="https://digital.library.cornell.edu/catalog/ss:20988329" linktype="simple" xlink:show="new">Click for Image</extref></unittitle><container id="aspace_939aed45753f2886b1460b688328e7e4" label="unspecified" type="box">62</container><container id="aspace_9a03323ad7f644a2b8137c575febf5b5" parent="aspace_939aed45753f2886b1460b688328e7e4" type="folder">104</container></did></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_0ae5647c03e7d41ffab759887a9a8b12" level="file"><did><unittitle>Freight Cars on Tracks</unittitle><container id="aspace_1f72af5dc7391a289875eecdb4f9e559" label="unspecified" type="box">63</container><container id="aspace_9557977b1ac7ac9d1c8dddc9fe9d1991" parent="aspace_1f72af5dc7391a289875eecdb4f9e559" type="folder">92</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_92c57b40c7770d420020583d48accba6"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Car floats and float bridge in background.

These photographs were submitted to the Commission as Employees' Exhibit 32, are referred to by the letter O in testimony, and were taken by L.A. Dubose. Mr. Dubose was employed as a locomotive fireman and engineer by the Louisville and Nashville in the Birmingham Mineral Subdivision; he was also a member of Local 751 of the BLF&amp;E. The L&amp;N was a class I railroad that operated freight and passenger services in the southeast United States, operating as far north as Cincinnati and St. Louis, and as far south as New Orleans and Pensacola. The photographs in this series document the yards around Birmingham, primarily Boyles and Bessemer Yards. This series also documents various industries served by the L&amp;N as well as the Birmingham Terminal Station, which was torn down in 1969.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_0173f1747422008c82a8cd820fe3cb9d" level="file"><did><unittitle>North End of the Boyles Departure and Hump Yard</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1960/1960">1960</unitdate><container id="aspace_82207441ad9001382e774cb2689d4231" label="unspecified" type="box">54</container><container id="aspace_a15d9a81d5502533452ed3554ccbe692" parent="aspace_82207441ad9001382e774cb2689d4231" type="folder">34</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_a49482279f4472b9942fd10bce05bf56"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The first track is a inbound freight lead.

In October, 1960, there was a side swipe at this point where the two engines are located in the right center portion of the picture. Both engines were headed south or to the left side of the photo. The fireman of one engine crew was in the yardmaster's office and not in the cab. One engine was not in the clear when the yardmaster instructed the engineer on the engine that temporarily was without a fireman to back up the lead track, causing the side-swipe. This side-swipe would have been avoided had the fireman been aboard. These and similar accidents are often avoided by the lookout performed by the fireman on the left side. These engines handle very long cuts of cars without air on the cars and it takes a long time to stop them after they are moving. Therefore, it is necessary to have two men on the engine so they can observe the signals regardless of which side they are passed on. Notice the two engines on the same switching lead. Each of the engines are headed south.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_bdf250f68a632e8b94d94b550b89895d" level="file"><did><unittitle>Item 1: <extref xlink:actuate="onrequest" xlink:href="https://digital.library.cornell.edu/catalog/ss:20433230" linktype="simple" xlink:show="new">Click for Image</extref></unittitle><container id="aspace_d007b860ef6768b815b7a84611d54345" label="unspecified" type="box">54</container><container id="aspace_97b885a65dc52e5e935f9c73cef0b445" parent="aspace_d007b860ef6768b815b7a84611d54345" type="folder">36</container></did></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_1b8bb655f125e5e041c9645b3b3cad91" level="file"><did><unittitle>View of the Tracks Approaching the Hump in Boyles Yard</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1960/1960">1960</unitdate><container id="aspace_893339321f3468c4f05c5497782afd8c" label="unspecified" type="box">54</container><container id="aspace_0d328ec53ae59c98bb040eec5519bfba" parent="aspace_893339321f3468c4f05c5497782afd8c" type="folder">37</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_d28cef1e81a60d2e675de5ecab4794da"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Notice the cars with the tractor pushing them.

This track leads off the main line just south of 15th Avenue. There is a GP-7 type engine used on this job. The track curves around and enters the door in the building, running through the building about twenty car lengths. There are men and machinery on and close to the track. In 1959 a yard engine coupled to a car that men were working on and cut a man's leg off. This track curves to the right then back to the left very sharply. There is very close clearance on each side of the building, making it very difficult for the ground crew to pass signals and position themselves where either the engineer or fireman can see them at all times. At the bottom of the photo is a road crossing which is very heavily used by plant trucks and cars.

This track leads off the main line just south of 15th Avenue. There is a GP-7 type engine used on this job. The track curves around and enters the door in the building, running through the building about twenty car lengths. There are men and machinery on and close to the track. In 1959 a yard engine coupled to a car that men were working on and cut a man's leg off. This track curves to the right then back to the left very sharply. There is very close clearance on each side of the building, making it very difficult for the ground crew to pass signals and position themselves where either the engineer or fireman can see them at all times. At the bottom of the photo is a road crossing which is very heavily used by plant trucks and cars. Also just before entering the building, there is an overhead crane moving back and forth over the track with steel and iron plates. To observe the movement of men, equipment and vehicles it is essential to have a fireman on the left side. Coming out of this plant, there is a coal yard that blocks the public view of the Ave. Also there is a Southern Railway track crossing the L&amp;N line just north of 15th Avenue.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_5983e9e0766b734736a48d39d26dd131" level="file"><did><unittitle>Item 1: <extref xlink:actuate="onrequest" xlink:href="https://digital.library.cornell.edu/catalog/ss:20433233" linktype="simple" xlink:show="new">Click for Image</extref></unittitle><container id="aspace_7c25e30e61219c2a1c3f5efe79404771" label="unspecified" type="box">54</container><container id="aspace_0d16925aea7388ab930aea9d96bc9563" parent="aspace_7c25e30e61219c2a1c3f5efe79404771" type="folder">39</container></did></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_350033ad7411f1d95e8d85bdb33036e4" level="file"><did><unittitle>View of the L&amp;N Main Llne on Right</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1960/1960">1960</unitdate><container id="aspace_ec1fa344099249f298b23cd4b98880f9" label="unspecified" type="box">54</container><container id="aspace_e2e5b86bb062a39789869c9bbc2c07a1" parent="aspace_ec1fa344099249f298b23cd4b98880f9" type="folder">40</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_fd4cdcc267d0beae584827c79df1ba23"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>On the right side of this photo is the L &amp; N main line. This area is in yard limits and the yard engines often leave cars on the main line while placing cars at some industries. Track has a sharp curve making it very important to have a fireman on the left side to help watch for cars and engines. Note the curvature in the upper right center part of the photo where cars are stored on the tracks. In July, 1961, I was a fireman on engine number 432, which is a GP-7 hooded type engine, making a reverse movement around this curve, when I saw a man laying on the track. I immediately opened the emergency brake valve located by the fireman's seat, stopping the engine and cars about three feet from the man. Due to the curve of the track the engineer did not see the man until he got off the engine.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_ead30070209e22b876aec24d5803ba4f" level="file"><did><unittitle>Item 1: <extref xlink:actuate="onrequest" xlink:href="https://digital.library.cornell.edu/catalog/ss:20433234" linktype="simple" xlink:show="new">Click for Image</extref></unittitle><container id="aspace_a35ddbce41c9466f1d21c479183507a0" label="unspecified" type="box">54</container><container id="aspace_2218219debea90866c5bfa596a52a4db" parent="aspace_a35ddbce41c9466f1d21c479183507a0" type="folder">40</container></did></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_2155e9e64298c67b685cd6adac74449b" level="file"><did><unittitle>L&amp;N Main Line Bisected by the Southern Railway Main Line</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1960/1960">1960</unitdate><container id="aspace_7da049e7993d350576073dcda70fe4d5" label="unspecified" type="box">54</container><container id="aspace_362a7114b31e86fbe8de42996cf395e9" parent="aspace_7da049e7993d350576073dcda70fe4d5" type="folder">41</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_09bc766f1c34aeefa75f9ca091dfe75b"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The tracks running diagonally from the lower left to the upper right portion of the picture are the L &amp; N main tracks.

The track to the left of the engine is the 30th Street Yard. Notice the curve of the track and the cross-over form the south main to the north main. Just to the right of the engines are two storage tracks running parallel with the main line. Yard engines use this cross-over to switch cars from storage tracks to the yard or vice versa. Note that the engines consist of two units coupled together cabs in the middle, with the long motor hood forward at each end. This makes it impossible for the engineer to see anything on the left side of the engine regardless of which direction the engine moves. Most of the L&amp;N engines are used in the multiple control, with engines headed in each direction. notice the cross-over to the left of the engine with cars hanging out of the clear. This is very dangerous and it is very important to have a fireman on the left side to watch out for these hazards. Also notice the wire across the tracks in front of the engine, which would not clear a man on top of cars.

This crossing is very heavily traveled in morning and late afternoon hours, and the view can be obstructed by autos and pedestrians.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_ac4e125291b1b7082b5b3f2a783b3196" level="file"><did><unittitle>Item 1: <extref xlink:actuate="onrequest" xlink:href="https://digital.library.cornell.edu/catalog/ss:20433244" linktype="simple" xlink:show="new">Click for Image</extref></unittitle><container id="aspace_53e06e3f7d5f43ae0f8ac60110a9ea00" label="unspecified" type="box">54</container><container id="aspace_d194aa1abfff46da5ca6242f2a2e8c01" parent="aspace_53e06e3f7d5f43ae0f8ac60110a9ea00" type="folder">49</container></did></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_1392138874a6f1751101257c62deab99" level="file"><did><unittitle>10th Avenue, Running East and West</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1960/1960">1960</unitdate><container id="aspace_3d1f6ce58ddf741a67287f7ce835994d" label="unspecified" type="box">54</container><container id="aspace_a72122ac577759610ae20fae411d3c93" parent="aspace_3d1f6ce58ddf741a67287f7ce835994d" type="folder">50</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_19e7435e2ff227f980e0d55055414314"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This is a view of 10th Avenue taken from a point opposite of that shown in exhibit O-14.

The L&amp;N crosses the Southern at the small building down the tracks. The two tracks at the bottom right hand corner of the photo service the L&amp;N freight house. There is very close clearance on each side and over-head. In spotting cars at the freight house, it is necessary to have a man on both sides of the engine to observe the numerous switch targets and crossovers. Note the curvature of the tracks going in to station at the station platforms. There will be baggage cars sitting on the walks. There are stairs going down to station and walkways across No. 2 and 3 tracks. While the passenger trains are in the station, switch engines will be switching over these walk ways. Also, SAL inspectors will be walking on and about the cars making it important to keep a close look out on each side of the engine. Note the small building to left of passenger station is a control tower. The L&amp;N crosses the southern tracks. The tracks make a very sharp turn to the left. There are 5 tracks running parallel with the main line and several crossovers that yard engine use at all times.

Notice the curve of the track and the trucks on the track. The engine has to enter at the bottom of the photo on the left side since the truck is a dead end at the top of the photo. Because of the curvature only the fireman on the left can see whether the trucks are clear of the track. If cars are to be spotted next to the building at the right of the photo, where the white car is parked, they have to be pulled behind the engine; if they are to be spotted at the top of the photo they have to be pushed ahead of the engine. There is also a cross-over in the middle of the photo. The track on the right side is a dead end track at each end, so the engine will have cars at each end of the engine, making it necessary to have a fireman on the left side to receive and relay signals and watch for the cars and trucks on the track. Because of the close clearance of the buildings in the right, signals must be passed on the fireman's side. Also observe the street crossing next to the freight house where trucks are parked. you must have a fireman on an engine pushing cars across a blind street. The track on the left side of photo O-20 is the one at the bottom of photo O-22. At places like this it is very difficult for the switchman to be in a position to be seen at all times, even with a fireman and an engineer on the engine.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_bcca2c5e5e9f95f3bb3c9020047adae1" level="file"><did><unittitle>Item 1: <extref xlink:actuate="onrequest" xlink:href="https://digital.library.cornell.edu/catalog/ss:20433253" linktype="simple" xlink:show="new">Click for Image</extref></unittitle><container id="aspace_c620ae47ea948b4efcca52ab7453c573" label="unspecified" type="box">54</container><container id="aspace_3bac215902de77df50ea873d495f4b6e" parent="aspace_c620ae47ea948b4efcca52ab7453c573" type="folder">58</container></did></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_00f3b3637507346417e7e3d49c262fca" level="file"><did><unittitle>Frisco Engine #206 Working a Scrap Yard on Georgia Road</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1960/1960">1960</unitdate><container id="aspace_3c5f1436a0f2693c012b71fd4fa6c4d3" label="unspecified" type="box">54</container><container id="aspace_b24394ba9ad9e73ccb35871384c60964" parent="aspace_3c5f1436a0f2693c012b71fd4fa6c4d3" type="folder">59</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_51391925ce45ded2f78a8a8451fd3ceb"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Notice the grass on track, also curvature of track.

It is hazardous switching on track like this.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_f05890e9cf7dd6d083a7f87f3069ff23" level="file"><did><unittitle>Item 1: <extref xlink:actuate="onrequest" xlink:href="https://digital.library.cornell.edu/catalog/ss:20433279" linktype="simple" xlink:show="new">Click for Image</extref></unittitle><container id="aspace_a695b75ad57059a165ea7b7190afc6cb" label="unspecified" type="box">54</container><container id="aspace_2f6aebd93ed33b7d8184b4ddad5004bc" parent="aspace_a695b75ad57059a165ea7b7190afc6cb" type="folder">82</container></did></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_00d553cd17d7c3ca28b6a768e7320057" level="file"><did><unittitle>L&amp;N Units 426 and 429 with Cars Sitting on the South Leg of the "Y" at Bessemer</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1960/1960">1960</unitdate><container id="aspace_f8b8e7e78d82e50a1e5c26ae511730e1" label="unspecified" type="box">54</container><container id="aspace_05bfae5abad7ae1282333e5ba89f5523" parent="aspace_f8b8e7e78d82e50a1e5c26ae511730e1" type="folder">83</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_420bdc1e3b5165f6dc1e0c76c3c7e4ff"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Sequence with O-26, O-27, O-28, O-29, O-31, O-32.

The engine has advanced just a little further along the rack. The engine at the top of the photo is entering a very heavily traveled street crossing, 19th Street. Notice the building at the top left corner of the picture. It blocks the motorists' view of the engine on the track. Due to the curvature of the track the engineer cannot see the street until the engine has entered the street crossing. There is also a main line switch in front of the house. The fireman is the only one who can see the switch and the crossing. The engineer operates in the blind, depending completely on the fireman for instructions. In this sequence of photos there are two GP7 hooded type engines coupled together.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_c28d20c615bc39db64fe9f9956a8b852" level="file"><did><unittitle>Item 1: <extref xlink:actuate="onrequest" xlink:href="https://digital.library.cornell.edu/catalog/ss:20433282" linktype="simple" xlink:show="new">Click for Image</extref></unittitle><container id="aspace_f5a3c8372a12e1b07db84d8320c7ba4a" label="unspecified" type="box">54</container><container id="aspace_a22d46d37f088b38c4b44548d07736c4" parent="aspace_f5a3c8372a12e1b07db84d8320c7ba4a" type="folder">85</container></did></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_5c982143cc6b7e15012baa41934bcf27" level="file"><did><unittitle>Seaboard Track Looking North from 10th Avenue North</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1960/1960">1960</unitdate><container id="aspace_5dcbf7d9aa86509c0e6dd002025db9ad" label="unspecified" type="box">54</container><container id="aspace_88de950f9f0fe94ccbd300e22f7e61cc" parent="aspace_5dcbf7d9aa86509c0e6dd002025db9ad" type="folder">86</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_351992affaed0975763184b1ac006fcc"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This is a view of the Seaboard Railroad track at 10th Avenue and 30th Street North, Birmingham, Alabama. Notice the insufficient clearance sign at the right side of the photo and also the trees and bushes where the box car is spotted in the upper left center. The grass along the track is very hazardous for the ground crew getting on and off the moving cars. At the upper corner left of the photo is 28th Street which is heavily traveled by trucks and autos. Also notice the stop sign at the left of the picture where in addition to the street crossing, there is also a railroad crossing. It is essential to have a fireman here to pass signals and observe the crossing.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_9fa157733ea40b31b04de0d70faae6f2" level="file"><did><unittitle>Item 1: <extref xlink:actuate="onrequest" xlink:href="https://digital.library.cornell.edu/catalog/ss:20433283" linktype="simple" xlink:show="new">Click for Image</extref></unittitle><container id="aspace_cc31eef4225ea52170ab4e0271096ffd" label="unspecified" type="box">54</container><container id="aspace_b7eebe7927e3088d7aa0a23975db4ea1" parent="aspace_cc31eef4225ea52170ab4e0271096ffd" type="folder">86</container></did></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_55a5195ff7c3a83368266a0c91fcf862" level="file"><did><unittitle>View from Fireman's Side of Locomotive While Pushing Flat Car and Gondola Through Nashville Bridge Plant</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1961/1961">1961</unitdate><container id="aspace_4aecf98bc70726fe71d808e455714c08" label="unspecified" type="box">58</container><container id="aspace_900f40b0d934767cf8dbc7c6c7097c1c" parent="aspace_4aecf98bc70726fe71d808e455714c08" type="folder">152</container></did><c03 id="aspace_ab7572898360ef84d454be03049739a8" level="file"><did><unittitle>Item 1: <extref xlink:actuate="onrequest" xlink:href="https://digital.library.cornell.edu/catalog/ss:20863444" linktype="simple" xlink:show="new">Click for Image</extref></unittitle><container id="aspace_4ac098505b1ac829d2129e0f2ca27e84" label="unspecified" type="box">58</container><container id="aspace_bd49fb2546daba32de68db9f7b03be91" parent="aspace_4ac098505b1ac829d2129e0f2ca27e84" type="folder">152</container></did></c03></c02></c01><c01 id="aspace_f59aba59bfbbb533dbdc66a8e69b077a" level="series"><did><unittitle>Series XV: Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (The Milwaukee Road): locomotives and rolling stock</unittitle></did><scopecontent id="aspace_a25801a40e4fae16dfc2bc88bfd67458"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This series consists of photographs of the some of the Milwaukee Road's locomotives and rolling stock.

This series documents piggy-backing operations in automobile lots as well as Milwaukee Road engines and flat cars. The location of these photographs is unknown. The Milwaukee Road was a class I railroad that operated in the Midwest and Northwest of the United States from 1847 until 1980. It is possible that these photographs were taken in either Minneapolis or Seattle as part of photographing Great Northern Railway facilities.</p></scopecontent><c02

These photographs were not submitted to the Commission as exhibits, but were mounted on cardboard and drawn on to highlight certain features of the Collinwood Yards. Collinwood Yards was one of the principal repair facilities and freight transfer points of the NYCRR. It included a brick roundhouse, built to house and repair locomotives; a machine shop, housing an engine room; a blacksmith shop; and an office constructed with upstairs apartments for the road's employees. The yards, situated along present-day E. 152nd St. just south of the Lakeland Freeway, were expanded in 1903 and again in 1929; at that time they included 120 miles of track and could handle 2,000 cars daily. In 1933 the facilities employed about 2,000 workers. By the end of World War II, the Collinwood Yards became a major switching and diesel repair facility for the NYCRR and later for the Penn Central Transportation Company.</p></scopecontent><c02

These photographs were not submitted to the Commission and as such do not have identifying exhibit numbers. The photographs in this series are arranged as a group because of their location and because the NP and the GN co-owned the Spokane, Portland &amp; Seattle Railway (SP&amp;S). The SP&amp;S was a joint venture between the two railroads, both controlled by James J. Hill, to build a railroad along the north bank of the Columbia River, connecting the two transcontinental railroads to Portland, Oregon from Spokane, Washington. The SP&amp;S served the new industries located along the river, including aluminum plants, sawmills, chemical factories and grain elevators. The photographs in this series depict industries in and around Spokane, the car end engine shops of the NP, and the Great Northern Train Station with its iconic clock tower which is the only part of the building that remains standing today.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_9586bca8aff4333b6d5cccd5074256c2" level="file"><did><unittitle>Grade Crossing</unittitle><container

Yards</unittitle></did><scopecontent id="aspace_ce550ae90b829028aeea56839316de04"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This series consists of photographs of the Norfolk and Western's facilities in Portsmouth and Norfolk, Virginia. These photographs were submitted to the Commission as Employees' Exhibit 39, are referred to by the letter B in testimony, and were taken by S.G. Vick. Mr. Vick was employed as an engineer in yard service by the N&amp;W and was the local chairman for the BLFE. The N&amp;W was a class I railroad operating in the southern United States. The N&amp;W operated both passenger and freight service, but was known for its routes between the coal fields in West Virginia and the ports and coal piers of Lambert's Point, Virginia. In 1959, the N&amp;W merged with the Virginian Railway (VGN), expanding their trackage in the south and Mid-Atlantic States. The photographs in this series document the extensive yard facilities of the N&amp;W in and around Lambert's Point, Virginia. This series also includes photos of VGN locomotives and rolling stock, and is also the only facility to be photographed from an airplane, giving the viewer a real sense of the scope of these facilities.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_ea10e40296b6bab37184a637f41add57" level="file"><did><unittitle>Norfolk and Portsmouth Belt Line Railroad Company Locomotive 102</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1960/1960">1960</unitdate><container id="aspace_f520639bba5374566ccb1de15977e278" label="unspecified" type="box">53</container><container id="aspace_45de451eea02dbb14b80342609e02937" parent="aspace_f520639bba5374566ccb1de15977e278" type="folder">89</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_d1c257ed10f3333d432850144ff59a19"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Locomotive 102 Manufacturer: EMD Model: SW 1200 at grade crossing near Coghill grain elevator</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_245e8802a1a3f638e202f2b32cfc849e" level="file"><did><unittitle>Item 1: <extref xlink:actuate="onrequest" xlink:href="https://digital.library.cornell.edu/catalog/ss:20432968" linktype="simple" xlink:show="new">Click for Image</extref></unittitle><container id="aspace_62ff3f54f5ad503afa00788b6ec0e01d" label="unspecified" type="box">53</container><container id="aspace_58bb86eb9220ba44df9d459bcb03da3a" parent="aspace_62ff3f54f5ad503afa00788b6ec0e01d" type="folder">89</container></did></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_d49afc7b03e86668bd96647128ab6f3c" level="file"><did><unittitle>Norfolk and Portsmouth Belt Line Railroad Company Locomotive 102</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1960/1960">1960</unitdate><container id="aspace_703772a5f9f8eae2e6a30bed7d9e9f34" label="unspecified" type="box">53</container><container id="aspace_1208e7ac63bf24ef0e9aa8a1b971d04f" parent="aspace_703772a5f9f8eae2e6a30bed7d9e9f34" type="folder">90</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_29c85e99c3ab44868c3ead47b60a6392"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Locomotive 102 Manufacturer: EMD Model: SW 1200 at grade crossing near Coghill grain elevator</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_128b9e931a39c0ae163dc67bbe173fb7" level="file"><did><unittitle>Item 1: <extref xlink:actuate="onrequest" xlink:href="https://digital.library.cornell.edu/catalog/ss:20432969" linktype="simple" xlink:show="new">Click for Image</extref></unittitle><container id="aspace_b67b1295e37fceb98e1f79848db10bdb" label="unspecified" type="box">53</container><container id="aspace_c3b077ac81e58fd65e6171b3d8a926fa" parent="aspace_b67b1295e37fceb98e1f79848db10bdb" type="folder">90</container></did></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_9cd41832c8f977fb91af476111d7fe34" level="file"><did><unittitle>Industry Surrounding Sewell's Point Yard</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1960/1960">1960</unitdate><container id="aspace_c000b4bb283f13254522a7ffd0a33692" label="unspecified" type="box">53</container><container id="aspace_9aef45967f63da117c8d6e3d0edfaf53" parent="aspace_c000b4bb283f13254522a7ffd0a33692" type="folder">91</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_e85b94138017348fe66c01cbcd788640"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Shows some of the industry in this area.

Close lookout must be maintained on both sides of the engine for trucks, automobiles, pedestrians, and other workmen in this general area.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_c9594188a42ffeab3cee5e46f6e8a6a9" level="file"><did><unittitle>Item 1: <extref xlink:actuate="onrequest" xlink:href="https://digital.library.cornell.edu/catalog/ss:20432970" linktype="simple" xlink:show="new">Click for Image</extref></unittitle><container id="aspace_a07e60bd18b013d53439ee17dc832377" label="unspecified" type="box">53</container><container id="aspace_ce75991b1d7cdd98bde5256c48d5267d" parent="aspace_a07e60bd18b013d53439ee17dc832377" type="folder">91</container></did></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_4157cbed2209d8b1abef763d907c0c55" level="file"><did><unittitle>NW Unit No. 35 and VGN coal car</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1960/1960">1960</unitdate><container id="aspace_e6c23b9b454b5fde40e4841607aa4619" label="unspecified" type="box">53</container><container id="aspace_9de9b533d955d90f19047811c97cbdfd" parent="aspace_e6c23b9b454b5fde40e4841607aa4619" type="folder">94</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_c70e8cb1c391097260a0da11748cdaec"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>NW Unit No. 35: Manufacturer: ALCO Model: T6, pulling coal car</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_242741fae0c19367cd84805831704a4f" level="file"><did><unittitle>Item 1: <extref xlink:actuate="onrequest" xlink:href="https://digital.library.cornell.edu/catalog/ss:20433020" linktype="simple" xlink:show="new">Click for Image</extref></unittitle><container id="aspace_0bc871226e234eee3302fbfcc944ea04" label="unspecified" type="box">53</container><container id="aspace_f697405c28284ced848d3fb818471db5" parent="aspace_0bc871226e234eee3302fbfcc944ea04" type="folder">94</container></did></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_1d762ed8068004fb749a7a337e5dee41" level="file"><did><unittitle>Freight Yard With Coal Hoppers</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1960/1960">1960</unitdate><container id="aspace_360849d9d3c61f473b4c1401c6a33940" label="unspecified" type="box">53</container><container id="aspace_2421ea74ad1b8c9bc421d5efae28dc80" parent="aspace_360849d9d3c61f473b4c1401c6a33940" type="folder">95</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_4a3f7f4ce2cc21c3cc7b28849478cf68"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Part of Lambert's Yard called the Soda Yard.

Because of this congestion, constant lookout is necessary on both sides of the engine..</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_2cae31ea0b211ad3346fe4280a851b5e" level="file"><did><unittitle>Item 1: <extref xlink:actuate="onrequest" xlink:href="https://digital.library.cornell.edu/catalog/ss:20864869" linktype="simple" xlink:show="new">Click for Image</extref></unittitle><container id="aspace_814288750eea07d77e6052fa172fc97b" label="unspecified" type="box">60</container><container id="aspace_5931eb8c430cb2fe97b6c197c509bee7" parent="aspace_814288750eea07d77e6052fa172fc97b" type="folder">99</container></did></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_56d41ae24b62b5fc0b9b5062e578455a" level="file"><did><unittitle>Norfolk and Portsmouth Belt Line Railroad Company Locomotive 102</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1960/1960">1960</unitdate><container id="aspace_0e6b17bce225d2b5b98193255f1f4696" label="unspecified" type="box">60</container><container id="aspace_e9c2e35a8f41c77f0a1ee0b34fcf9d59" parent="aspace_0e6b17bce225d2b5b98193255f1f4696" type="folder">121</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_ea06d3d88ea77ee915c899dfdf9188a7"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Locomotive 102 Manufacturer: EMD Model: SW 1200 at grade crossing near Coghill grain elevator</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_bf6aa2bd3d654d7797589b8718420634" level="file"><did><unittitle>Item 1: <extref xlink:actuate="onrequest" xlink:href="https://digital.library.cornell.edu/catalog/ss:20864902" linktype="simple" xlink:show="new">Click for Image</extref></unittitle><container id="aspace_9e0ea7e4d3b05d19876dfb0de0ac6440" label="unspecified" type="box">60</container><container id="aspace_354e94f878aab99ca7f11b0b727c9acb" parent="aspace_9e0ea7e4d3b05d19876dfb0de0ac6440" type="folder">121</container></did></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_10c6a124005f8b9e8447f7c01857d1e7" level="file"><did><unittitle>South Side of Pier No. 5, North Side Pier No. 4</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1960/1960">1960</unitdate><container id="aspace_da1790a7cb7fac97fe87009e924fbaea" label="unspecified" type="box">61</container><container id="aspace_15eadf6b1b67db6704575dd4f3dd7849" parent="aspace_da1790a7cb7fac97fe87009e924fbaea" type="folder">77</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_e81a7bf7bcde504a5e222d1b5b96ae9b"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Shows the south side of pier No. 5 and the north side of pier No. 4.

These multiple units, which are about 112 feet in overall length, are used in classifying trains having as many as 100 coal cars. Because of the length of the trains, the ground crew at the rear end of the train cannot be seen at all times form the cab. In order to permit signal passing from one end of the train to the other, the carrier has supplied the conductor with switching lights. These switching lights, which the conductor sets up on a stand about the height of a switch stand, are not always within the engineer's view, because of curvatures, and it is frequently necessary for the aspect of the switch lights to be relayed from the fireman to the engineer.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_8441f5e2cee4caac6f77840a8b067aa7" level="file"><did><unittitle>Item 1: <extref xlink:actuate="onrequest" xlink:href="https://digital.library.cornell.edu/catalog/ss:20988153" linktype="simple" xlink:show="new">Click for Image</extref></unittitle><container id="aspace_8e69d95ee55ac3aa0396100c8321537d" label="unspecified" type="box">61</container><container id="aspace_8bb059caa613f33e99835b133816ba92" parent="aspace_8e69d95ee55ac3aa0396100c8321537d" type="folder">88</container></did></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_c9edd44d5dc641d363c2d6daa9307889" level="file"><did><unittitle>Cars on East End of Main Coal Yards at Lambert's Point</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1960/1960">1960</unitdate><container id="aspace_5021d7e0296f91efa3ac48a0a54ae766" label="unspecified" type="box">61</container><container id="aspace_9ba5c3c8230bdf9340a1e8e3d55c52ea" parent="aspace_5021d7e0296f91efa3ac48a0a54ae766" type="folder">89</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_ffb184e1a06ae8c40957dacfcd23ebc5"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Opposite No. 4 Coal Pier where coal is dumped into docked ships.

They crossover in front of locomotives from both engineer and fireman's side of locomotive. Shows the Ford Automobile Assembly plant. This assignment is extremely hazardous. To minimize idle time of its employees, Ford management requires us to put cars into the plant when its employees are on their lunch hour. The fireman and I have to maintain constant lookout for these employees who cross over in front of the locomotive at all times. In addition, when we pull out of the plant, signals frequently have to be given on the fireman's side. All of the switch movements there are under pressure because of the time limitations imposed. A large number of people who reside in the area or who work in adjacent plants, walk across the lead and main tracks shown here even though there is an overpass. As recently as April 27, 1961, at about 4:00 PM, my fireman prevented a serious accident here. We were switching a draft of cars which we had taken out of the Ford Assembly plant. I had backed the locomotive down the track and stopped. Just after I received a signal from the brakeman on my crew to go ahead, my fireman hollered for me to stop. I immediately stopped the locomotive and as informed that a man carrying a bicycle under his arm was crossing over about two or three feet in front of the locomotive. I had no way of knowing that anyone was crossing over so close to the front of the locomotive except by having an alert fireman on the left side of the locomotive.

The two piers in the lower left foreground are coal piers where coal is dumped directly into docked ships. Looking at the tracks in the picture from left to right, those on the far left, which is the south end of the yard, are the empty yard tracks for departing trains. The tracks, beginning about 12 or 15 tracks from the left, are those in the Barney or Hump yard. In this yard, coal cars are pushed up to the piers for dumping. Further to the right is a group of about 100 tracks, which comprise the classification and storage yard and the main coal yard at Lamberts Point. Just to the right and below the main coal yard is another group of 50 to 100 tracks which are also used for classification and storage, and which are sometimes called the Soda Yard. Directly in the center of the picture is the roundhouse and just below that are the tracks in the repair yard. To the right and slightly up from the roundhouse is another group of forty tracks used for classification and storage of freight cars. Further up and to the right are additional tracks and a series of warehouses which end at the water's edge, and three general merchandise piers where you can see several ships tied up. The picture clearly shows the curvatures on all tracks in Lamberts Point Yard. It also gives some idea of the number of cars handled here. The Lamberts Point Yard has about eight crews reporting on each shift. There are also four regular time freight crews that come in to Lamberts Point daily and also pool freight crews having about 200 coal cars in a consist. The yard crews in the main coal yard all work with double units because of the heavy tonnage involved, and are constantly moving over crossovers which are about 20 in number and 100 to 150 feet in length, at the west end of the yard.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_8ef3860847ffbc430da48a570f3e6cfd" level="file"><did><unittitle>Item 1: <extref xlink:actuate="onrequest" xlink:href="https://digital.library.cornell.edu/catalog/ss:20988239" linktype="simple" xlink:show="new">Click for Image</extref></unittitle><container id="aspace_862928fe3503e11a16c5be9fc20046dd" label="unspecified" type="box">62</container><container id="aspace_080eb2c32144f0ee9a17e5fbfd680a30" parent="aspace_862928fe3503e11a16c5be9fc20046dd" type="folder">14</container></did></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_1d715e8f879caa435e369e29c67f038a" level="file"><did><unittitle>NW Unit No. 35 and VGN coal car</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1960/1960">1960</unitdate><container id="aspace_86687a124e59dea03ae9ce742e8e0092" label="unspecified" type="box">62</container><container id="aspace_de76638305c3ed55ab0e93abced39ebc" parent="aspace_86687a124e59dea03ae9ce742e8e0092" type="folder">15</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_5be10ea8df154c95d8a5688d88c3c8a9"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>NW Unit No. 35: Manufacturer: ALCO Model: T6.

The coal cars here are a portion of the 7,000 to 8,000 cars this yard ordinarily holds. The empty tracks in the foreground are the pull-in tracks. There are four or five coal testing companies that have employees in the main coal and Barney Yards. These men are constantly climbing cars for coal samples to be tested. There is also a considerable number of car riders in the Barney yard who ride coal cars to the piers. Sometimes there are ship personnel near the east end of the main coal yard. There are also car repairers, clerks, roundhouse personnel and other regular yard employees scattered throughout the Lambert's Point yard. Engine crews must be and are on the alert continuously for these men. The Lambert's Point yard has many curves--first to the right and then to the left--which also require the engineman and the fireman to be on the alert at all times. Because of the heavy tonnage being handled, two units are in operation on all crews.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_07abca6a5aa58034bfeb03839b4df905" level="file"><did><unittitle>Item 1: <extref xlink:actuate="onrequest" xlink:href="https://digital.library.cornell.edu/catalog/ss:20988241" linktype="simple" xlink:show="new">Click for Image</extref></unittitle><container id="aspace_b007a83177fabc31821b06494b8e533f" label="unspecified" type="box">62</container><container id="aspace_dc9436df7cdf99364147df8caa0b0350" parent="aspace_b007a83177fabc31821b06494b8e533f" type="folder">16</container></did></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_bad67c3dd0bdaf3e77a92a7183622e2c" level="file"><did><unittitle>View from Fireman's Side of Locomotive</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1960/1960">1960</unitdate><container id="aspace_5ab14316259ce0f15fa9c6dfb3f026c6" label="unspecified" type="box">62</container><container id="aspace_38cd3b96310e9e0484bb6a37bbf80755" parent="aspace_5ab14316259ce0f15fa9c6dfb3f026c6" type="folder">17</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_464620b099e6fa495432a372adcf1524"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The tracks shown on the left side are the west side main line and pull-in tracks which run parallel to the Portlock yard.

The yard crews in the main coal yard all work with double units because of the heavy tonnage involved, and are constantly moving over crossovers which are about 20 in number and 100 to 150 feet in length, at the west end of the yard.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_497be5475df96501fa23f57285d924ce" level="file"><did><unittitle>Item 1: <extref xlink:actuate="onrequest" xlink:href="https://digital.library.cornell.edu/catalog/ss:20988454" linktype="simple" xlink:show="new">Click for Image</extref></unittitle><container id="aspace_37dc6f45075ceac3341a8e21a62b8886" label="unspecified" type="box">63</container><container id="aspace_2871070464a7a51107aa1e4046ec0957" parent="aspace_37dc6f45075ceac3341a8e21a62b8886" type="folder">112</container></did></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_53fe05c2bd8d1795c27f6acac8f52e52" level="file"><did><unittitle>Aerial photograph of Lambert's Point Yard</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1960/1960">1960</unitdate><container id="aspace_950a97cdd33165f3e8209ccf651a4ac9" label="unspecified" type="box">63</container><container id="aspace_acc114fd60c8910ecad893184077a0b0" parent="aspace_950a97cdd33165f3e8209ccf651a4ac9" type="folder">113</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_bbfdbaf59a110afe7bd5b52ab9c84085"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Aerial photograph of the Lamberts Point Yard. The two piers in the lower left foreground are coal piers where coal is dumped directly into docked ships. Looking at the tracks in the picture from left to right, those on the far left, which is the south end of the yard, are the empty yard tracks for departing trains. The tracks, beginning about 12 or 15 tracks from the left, are those in the Barney or Hump yard. In this yard, coal cars are pushed up to the piers for dumping. Further to the right is a group of about 100 tracks, which comprise the classification and storage yard and the main coal yard at Lamberts Point. Just to the right and below the main coal yard is another group of 50 to 100 tracks which are also used for classification and storage, and which are sometimes called the Soda Yard. Directly in the center of the picture is the roundhouse and just below that are the tracks in the repair yard. To the right and slightly up from the roundhouse is another group of forty tracks used for classification and storage of freight cars. Further up and to the right are additional tracks and a series of warehouses which end at the water's edge, and three general merchandise piers where you can see several ships tied up. The picture clearly shows the curvatures on all tracks in Lamberts Point Yard. It also gives some idea of the number of cars handled here. The Lamberts Point Yard has about eight crews reporting on each shift. There are also four regular time freight crews that come in to Lamberts Point daily and also pool freight crews having about 200 coal cars in a consist. The yard crews in the main coal yard all work with double units because of the heavy tonnage involved, and are constantly moving over crossovers which are about 20 in number and 100 to 150 feet in length, at the west end of the yard.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_0ab67090130dbf8b2e280cd0cf0b9049" level="file"><did><unittitle>Item 1: <extref xlink:actuate="onrequest" xlink:href="https://digital.library.cornell.edu/catalog/ss:20988455" linktype="simple" xlink:show="new">Click for Image</extref></unittitle><container id="aspace_827ea07fb72a2fd3086e4977e50f5738" label="unspecified" type="box">63</container><container id="aspace_ddbca8a96f11499c2e020c8f74aa3462" parent="aspace_827ea07fb72a2fd3086e4977e50f5738" type="folder">113</container></did></c03></c02></c01><c01 id="aspace_cdf3b84b73ea9c474e81bd613de8406c" level="series"><did><unittitle>Series XIX: New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad: Yards and Tracks from New York City to Boston, Massachusetts</unittitle></did><scopecontent id="aspace_473e4bb07a847ddc22b06d8bd53e1efa"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This series consists of photographs of the New York, New Haven and Hartford's facilities along the northeast corridor between New York and Boston. These photographs were submitted to the Commission as Employees' Exhibit 46, are referred to by the letters D and D/R in testimony, and were taken by Edgar R. Guinea. Mr. Guinea was employed as an engineer by the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad. The New Haven was a railroad that operated in northeastern United States between New York and Boston, with branches running through New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts. The photographs in this series document the route between New York City and Boston, including pictures of the tunnels below Grand Central Terminal; the Harlem River Yard in the Bronx; the passenger depot in Stamford, Connecticut; the yards and industries in and around New Haven; and the New Haven's facilities in South Boston. This is one of the few series in this collection that documents an entire route of a carrier.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_12c8987e87bd9ee1627c2044f1979c1e" level="file"><did><unittitle>Water Street Yard and Mail Shed</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1961/1961">1961</unitdate><container id="aspace_5fccacc3f7a323f304eb8658fb469252" label="unspecified" type="box">56</container><container id="aspace_d25e81bbaf5d39b4f38d3f37a2d34119" parent="aspace_5fccacc3f7a323f304eb8658fb469252" type="folder">56</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_1fe1d063f57022927dabd82ce4fbe997"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Another view of the Water Street Yard showing the mail shed where mail handlers work 24 hours a day.

These photographs were submitted to the Commission as Employees' Exhibit 6, are referred to by the letter H in testimony, and were taken by J.H. Ritchie. Mr. Ritchie was employed as a fireman and engineer for the Pennsylvania Railroad, working in both road and yard service, assigned to work the Enola Yards. The Pennsylvania Railroad was a class I railroad operating in the Mid-Atlantic and Midwestern United States, with its headquarters in Pennsylvania. This series document's the PRR's facilities in and around Harrisburg. This includes the Enola Yards, which was the largest freight yard in the world until 1956. The Enola Yards contained a diesel locomotive shop, a 43-stall roundhouse, two hump classification yards, and 145 miles of track. The Enola Yards were electrified in 1938, and the pictures in this series show some of those power lines. This series also contains photographs of the Harrisburg Penn Station, one of many of the stations and terminals built by the PRR. This station was built in 1887 and is a designated National Historic Landmark.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_8513d787d39f956926a057c0c66a897f" level="file"><did><unittitle>Harrisburg Penn Station</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1960/1960">1960</unitdate><container id="aspace_a8303b15419c282b17d428af1ee7d7af" label="unspecified" type="box">53</container><container id="aspace_eb125ad17b51a2fe637178fb561b5a5c" parent="aspace_a8303b15419c282b17d428af1ee7d7af" type="folder">155</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_362a6aa4180dae01b7c81f16daea2588"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Taken from the Mulberry Street overhead bridge</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_4058b18c5faab36b104c90a8096c41a5" level="file"><did><unittitle>Item 1: <extref xlink:actuate="onrequest" xlink:href="https://digital.library.cornell.edu/catalog/ss:20433153" linktype="simple" xlink:show="new">Click for Image</extref></unittitle><container id="aspace_f3dde8ba412d35a7601a05d43b467872" label="unspecified" type="box">53</container><container id="aspace_629dd7eb7b174df5375b4fb42ae69c55" parent="aspace_f3dde8ba412d35a7601a05d43b467872" type="folder">155</container></did></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_f5c5ddb9c0a71c4d33850cc282ee5b2a" level="file"><did><unittitle>Freight Yard and Caboose Tracks</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1960/1960">1960</unitdate><container id="aspace_f2a834743a8a158f5d0ea4e8af2e3ab9" label="unspecified" type="box">53</container><container id="aspace_8aeb7663cf19af531eb988b1ddef2b22" parent="aspace_f2a834743a8a158f5d0ea4e8af2e3ab9" type="folder">193</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_7b974a527a18f15efae6fe0700b32498"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Taken at the extreme west end of the Enola Yard, looking eastward.

These photographs were not submitted to the Commission and as such do not have identifying exhibit numbers. It is possible that these were taken by J.H. Ritchie as part of documenting types of engines, but that is a tentative identification. The Reading Company, a multifaceted industrial corporation with diverse interests such as shipbuilding, coal mining and iron making, operated a railroad in southeastern Pennsylvania and neighboring states New York, New Jersey, and Delaware.

Georgia. These photographs were submitted to the Commission without an Employees' Exhibit number but are described in written testimony submitted in Employees' Exhibit 29, are referred to by the letter U in testimony, and were taken by T.A. Whitworth. (N.B.: these photographs are misidentified in verbal testimony as Exhibit 99, which are photographs of Los Angeles.) Mr. Whitworth was employed by the Southern as a locomotive fireman and was a member of Lodge 651 of the BLF&amp;E. The Southern is a class I railroad operating in the southern United States, now known as Norfolk Southern Railway. The photographs in this series document the Southern facilities in Atlanta, Georgia. Inman Yards was built in 1957 and remains one of the major hubs of the Norfolk Southern system. This series documents the yard operations, industries in and around Atlanta that were served by the Southern, and portions of downtown Atlanta. Also photographed are sections of the Atlanta Terminal Yards and the L&amp;N main lines.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_08b2fbad035ab7a97625a87a4122551e" level="file"><did><unittitle>Grade Crossing at Ashby Street</unittitle><container id="aspace_723e4a341594e934a818f7534470060a" label="unspecified" type="box">57</container><container id="aspace_067f0ac56ee907ac4c1a5bdbc26d3569" parent="aspace_723e4a341594e934a818f7534470060a" type="folder">67</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_1a24b8e127dda4e481a6b359a3ecc98c"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Shows the Atlantic Coast line at the Ashby Street crossing, looking east.

These photographs were submitted to the Commission as Employees' Exhibit 99, are referred to by the letters BB, and were taken by B.J. Mahoney. There is no extant testimony for these photographs, but there are hand written notes describing their contents. The Southern Pacific was a class I railroad in the western United States. It covered a vast territory, with lines stretching from New Orleans through Texas, New Mexico and Arizona to Los Angeles; from Los Angeles up the West Coast through San Francisco and Sacramento to Portland, Oregon; from Chicago through St. Louis to Dallas and Ft. Worth, Texas; and from San Francisco through Nevada to Ogden, Utah. The Sunset Route, between New Orleans and Los Angeles, went through El Paso, Tucson and Phoenix, with a branch line heading south into Mexico at Nogales. The photographs in this series document the SP facilities in Los Angeles and a small portion of the surrounding city.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_53359c80f8252090e9e5e0fd18d6b370" level="file"><did><unittitle>Looking South in the "C" Yard of the Southern Pacific Yards, SP Units No. 5239 and 1408</unittitle><container id="aspace_ff19fc8f1b7225372b8e25fd16a6be1e" label="unspecified" type="box">63</container><container id="aspace_8dc96e22e0fedf4b4222867bd0532b18" parent="aspace_ff19fc8f1b7225372b8e25fd16a6be1e" type="folder">121</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_b4c58a23952cdfbc9c505103d56cab94"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Picture shows relatively few cars for this yard and only two engines.

Oakland, California. These photographs were submitted to the Commission as Employees' Exhibit 25, are referred to by the letter R in testimony, and were taken by R. Vawter. Mr. Vawter was employed in engine service on the Western Division of the Southern Pacific Company, Pacific Lines, in the yards in Oakland, California. The West Oakland Yards were more than 30 miles long, and served the entire East Bay of the San Francisco metropolitan area. The Southern Pacific was a class I railroad in the western United States. It covered a vast territory, with lines stretching from New Orleans through Texas, New Mexico and Arizona to Los Angeles; from Los Angeles up the West Coast through San Francisco and Sacramento to Portland, Oregon; from Chicago through St. Louis to Dallas and Ft. Worth, Texas; and from San Francisco through Nevada to Ogden, Utah. The Sunset Route, between New Orleans and Los Angeles, went through El Paso, Tucson and Phoenix, with a branch line heading south into Mexico at Nogales. The photographs in this series document the SP facilities in Oakland as well as the industries it served and portions of downtown Oakland, California including the Fruitvale Cannery station, now a commuter station on the BART system.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_8d20c043bbca25188c36f938eb453bc4" level="file"><did><unittitle>Looking East Toward West Oakland Diesel Shop</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1960/1960">1960</unitdate><container id="aspace_b97bb08206466457f366b16f8711d31d" label="unspecified" type="box">54</container><container id="aspace_87c28c4ee4bc07fea52ac8c9f02e4daf" parent="aspace_b97bb08206466457f366b16f8711d31d" type="folder">87</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_ab0cb5aff5839c3a061e6733c3b726b8"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Shows the West Oakland Diesel Shop.

These photographs were submitted to the Commission as Employees' Exhibit 48, are referred to by the letter W in testimony, and were taken by Audry A. Harp. Mr. Harp was employed as a locomotive engineer by the Southern Pacific and was a member Lodge 617 of the BLF&amp;E. The Southern Pacific was a class I railroad in the western United States. It covered a vast territory, with lines stretching from New Orleans through Texas, New Mexico and Arizona to Los Angeles; from Los Angeles up the West Coast through San Francisco and Sacramento to Portland, Oregon; from Chicago through St. Louis to Dallas and Ft. Worth, Texas; and from San Francisco through Nevada to Ogden, Utah. The Sunset Route, between New Orleans and Los Angeles, went through El Paso, Tucson and Phoenix, with a branch line heading south into Mexico at Nogales. The photographs in this series document the SP facilities in El Paso. Of interest are the signs printed in both English and Spanish for the SP employees that are documented in this series. Also included in this series is a photograph of industry tracks to Darbyshire Steel Co., tentatively identified as located in El Paso, Texas.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_8f7b1e5411d2dd93a308d862eaead86d" level="file"><did><unittitle>Southern Pacific Alfalfa Yard</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1960/1960">1960</unitdate><container id="aspace_eb2bd839182ebf530a7559c10c75ae30" label="unspecified" type="box">63</container><container id="aspace_2805e25f0655d15b87c66fcc3cfa17fa" parent="aspace_eb2bd839182ebf530a7559c10c75ae30" type="folder">67</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_df5db4aec7e5b2ffa49d6ccbac463b35"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Picture W-1 was taken in the Adair or Alfalfa yard looking west from the "Little Flower" grade crossing which is just off the bottom of the picture and not visible here. This is a heavily trafficked crossing as there is an extremely heavily populated residential area off to the right of the picture. Although this crossing is protected 24 hours a day by crossing flagman, as trains approach from either direction on the main track, while yard engines are also approaching on the tracks on the right, the flagman cannot be in a position to protect the crossing against all of the movements. Hence it is essential to have a lookout on both sides of each locomotive to help protect the public at the grade crossing. The fireman is also necessary to help observe the low switch targets which may be noted in the center and center background of the picture and also to protect against other train movements at the carious crossovers shows in the center of the picture. He is also essential to maintain a lookout on track curvatures such as the one in the right center portion of the picture. He is also essential to maintain a lookout on track curvatures such as the one in the right center portion of the picture. The track leads to various industries including Standard Oil Refinery and the Phelps Dodge Copper Company. In this picture, the mainline tracks are the two tracks in the left hand portion of the picture. The track coming in at the lower right hand corner of the picture and running up through the center background of the picture is a lead track and the two tracks which connect up with this track coming in at the center portion of this picture and running up through the center background of the picture is a lead track and the two tracks which connect up with this track coming in at the center portion of this picture and running off the right center portion of this picture are the tracks which connect to tracks 14 through 26. It is on these tracks that trains are made up and broken up. These tracks have reverse curvatures and when engines are working at the west end the view around the curve is visible only from the fireman's side. If the engines are working on the east end, the view from the curve is visible only from the fireman's side again.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_299e11e833eea5beb3c5972eeecb7b1c" level="file"><did><unittitle>Item 1: <extref xlink:actuate="onrequest" xlink:href="https://digital.library.cornell.edu/catalog/ss:20988409" linktype="simple" xlink:show="new">Click for Image</extref></unittitle><container id="aspace_b21dbf0760b05825a2e2ec1b9f9a5115" label="unspecified" type="box">63</container><container id="aspace_ab3c46f565506d38713ec91032d3f8df" parent="aspace_b21dbf0760b05825a2e2ec1b9f9a5115" type="folder">67</container></did></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_4f245594fbfdd7a61408bcdd3e79a107" level="file"><did><unittitle>Southern Pacific Alfalfa Yard</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1960/1960">1960</unitdate><container id="aspace_9c09318ccc8c41c838bf2acf7386923d" label="unspecified" type="box">63</container><container id="aspace_7ef3c7699037e456af8fee9f30674aea" parent="aspace_9c09318ccc8c41c838bf2acf7386923d" type="folder">68</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_4bfd535679ea095889658b02dab77f8a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Looking northwest from the "Little Flower" public crossing and between the drill track and crossover to Texaco industrial lead also showing the Fort Bliss industrial track curving to the right.

In the immediate foreground is the "Little Flower" road crossing previously referred to. Inbound Texas and New Orleans (T. and N.O.) trains are yarded here and most of the Eastline westbound and Northline westbound trains depart from this yard. In the center of the picture you will notice a caboose which is standing on the westbound mainline, indicating that the train has proceeded into the yard against the current of traffic. Several tracks over from the caboose to the left you will notice a train made up with a carbody and keep type locomotive prepared to leave the yard and standing just in the clear of the switching lead track. When such trains move off the classification track onto and down the ladder track toward the grade crossing in the center of the picture, only the fireman would have a view of any other train movements approaching the ladder track from the right side of the train as you face the picture. Similarly, with switch engines headed west, the switch targets will be on the engineer's side and the switchmen will work and pass signals on the engineer's side. However, only the fireman on the left side of the engine will have a view of other train and yard movements to the east and further back in the picture and the fireman is therefore essential to maintain a lookout for any movements which might affect the train in that direction. In the lower left hand portion of the photograph is the crossover from the mainline into tracks 1 through 13. The engine which may be seen just below the tree and in back of the buildings in the left hand center portion of the photograph is on the lead connecting with tracks 14 through 26. You can readily see the curvature of these tracks. Even when the fireman is not taking signals, it is essential to have him aboard to maintain a lookout for other trains for other train movements and yard and switch-crew personnel who are moving on or about the tracks.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_d92314e0e80a5318c1d0c6fe83007055" level="file"><did><unittitle>Item 1: <extref xlink:actuate="onrequest" xlink:href="https://digital.library.cornell.edu/catalog/ss:20988411" linktype="simple" xlink:show="new">Click for Image</extref></unittitle><container id="aspace_fc728a16f84b58b4165ed6d16c46ebc8" label="unspecified" type="box">63</container><container id="aspace_178bb69a37479997f90f21e359e12aa3" parent="aspace_fc728a16f84b58b4165ed6d16c46ebc8" type="folder">69</container></did></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_a952a89045b4a26279bb805dcaa54ff6" level="file"><did><unittitle>Southern Pacific Uptown Yards A, B, C, D, and E</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1960/1960">1960</unitdate><container id="aspace_261b4fd444e0d57e8cb53d2be28cb9cb" label="unspecified" type="box">63</container><container id="aspace_0e173683e15ec42542dcdbbb96f2fa2b" parent="aspace_261b4fd444e0d57e8cb53d2be28cb9cb" type="folder">70</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_b67add2037b4668c275df40626ae4400"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Picture W-3 shows the Southern Pacific's uptown yards A, B, C, D, and E. the camera was facing west when this picture was taken. To the right are the ice docks; further to the right and not seen here are the A and B yards. There is a track on either side of the docks, each of which holds about 100 cars. It is on these tracks that cars handling perishables are iced. A lookout must be maintained for me working in and about this area from both sides of the locomotive. These tracks also proceed through interlocking No. 47, the signal to which is displayed on the fireman's side and he must be there to observe it. Also cars roll out of the tracks and foul the lead from time and this condition is frequently observable only by the fireman. In addition, yard engines frequently work on the A and B yard leads at the same time. The cars in the center of the picture are the C yard classification tracks. It is on these tracks that trains are made up for departure. Tracks 17 through 28 all connect with one lead track and although switches are on the engineer's side, it is essential to have a fireman to maintain a lookout for the movement of other trains and yard engines and ground personnel. In the upper left hand portion of the picture are the D and E yard tracks and the rip tracks. The E yard lead track is curved and the crossover from E yard to D yard lead is observable from the fireman's side of the locomotive.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_3d186d2a9cf9616822eb22a059f28013" level="file"><did><unittitle>Item 1: <extref xlink:actuate="onrequest" xlink:href="https://digital.library.cornell.edu/catalog/ss:20988412" linktype="simple" xlink:show="new">Click for Image</extref></unittitle><container id="aspace_c8424f20a9fa3ca2de88728f086f8d03" label="unspecified" type="box">63</container><container id="aspace_b1856b14ad9d285ea9e3a859d886c84a" parent="aspace_c8424f20a9fa3ca2de88728f086f8d03" type="folder">70</container></did></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_5d7bdc49aefb7c87bf22e0a6f7d82833" level="file"><did><unittitle>Southern Pacific Uptown Yards</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1960/1960">1960</unitdate><container id="aspace_273c8d2d40d21310bcf8853153cd7b4e" label="unspecified" type="box">63</container><container id="aspace_c3a6b96c5f8845fc54f069ea670c611a" parent="aspace_273c8d2d40d21310bcf8853153cd7b4e" type="folder">71</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_5c1158717cec362f2f5d3c2e74cafd86"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>A-B-C-D and E Yards, which were explained in exhibit W-4.

On the upper left hand portion of the picture are East and West mainlines. Locomotive number 60 is on the westbound main track. To the right of the main lines are the A yard tracks and lead track. These are approximately in the center of the picture. Further to the right where the low-top cars are standing are the B yard tracks and B yard lead track. On the extreme right is the ice dock and the ice dock tracks. With yard engines facing the camera in this picture, the switch stands and ground crew are positioned on the engineer's side or right hand side of the locomotive. These switch points can be observed along the lead tracks of the A and B yards in the left center and center background portions of the picture. Signals are ordinarily passed here on the engineer's side. However, you will also note that the tracks all curve in from the lead in both the A and B yards from the fireman's side and only the fireman is in a position to see from the locomotive any movement of cars or other engines on other tracks that may be conflicting with his movement. In addition to keeping a lookout for cars rolling out or other movements from the classification tracks onto the ladder tracks in the A and B yards, the fireman is also essential to observe the interlocking signals. Although these interlocking signals are observable from both sides of the locomotive when the engine is far enough away from them, as the engine approaches, the engineer's view is cut off by the length of the hood of the locomotive or the cars ahead of the locomotive and only the fireman will be in a position to observe such signals.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_e6dc830ab098ddf8e74f34a1881de23a" level="file"><did><unittitle>Item 1: <extref xlink:actuate="onrequest" xlink:href="https://digital.library.cornell.edu/catalog/ss:20988414" linktype="simple" xlink:show="new">Click for Image</extref></unittitle><container id="aspace_c5c585b4067dd32054dc56f191dbb897" label="unspecified" type="box">63</container><container id="aspace_181c6359e19fa4857f231b7dc7fe47e0" parent="aspace_c5c585b4067dd32054dc56f191dbb897" type="folder">72</container></did></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_e9c8bb47cf70382c40a2302c7acc0d91" level="file"><did><unittitle>Southern Pacific Uptown Yards, D and E Yard Leads</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1960/1960">1960</unitdate><container id="aspace_7af81cbe15c11c521c4f3033c7cba988" label="unspecified" type="box">63</container><container id="aspace_b3a03e8e51a8b7411cffcb195615f91f" parent="aspace_7af81cbe15c11c521c4f3033c7cba988" type="folder">73</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_62f733637456a96b635d55ab66ab41e2"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Picture W-6 depicts the Uptown El Paso yards and the D and E leads. The D yard lead track is the straight track running up through the center of the picture into the center background where it intersects with track No. 31 under the viaduct. The row of box cars is standing on track 31. The E yard lead track is the track which runs off the right hand center portion of the picture just behind the small building in the lower right hand corner of the picture. This lead also crosses over the trackage in the center of the picture. There is a crossover there from the D yard lead and also crossovers with a track where the Texas and Pacific deliveries are made. Not particularly the sharp curvature in the E yard lead track and the "S" curvatures in what is sometimes used as a Texas &amp; Pacific delivery track which is to the right of the D yard lead track and which is frequently used by yard engines to by-pass the E yard lead when it is occupied. The E yard lead track connects with a series of tracks that are used for repair track service and also to storage tracks for cars destined for industries in El Paso and Fort Bliss. There cars are stored and switched for transfer to the Santa Fe and various industries around the river area. When switching on the E yard lead fireman is essential to maintain a lookout because of the track curvature and the number of transfer and crossover movements in the area. Switching here is also dangerous because there are narrow clearances under viaduct in the center of picture where the tracks converge and the pillars from the overpass obstruct vision. With engineer busily engaged in taking signals from the ground crew in this locale, the fireman must be looking ahead for other train or yard movements in the area.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_fd63744f018c2492c46eb45340086686" level="file"><did><unittitle>Item 1: <extref xlink:actuate="onrequest" xlink:href="https://digital.library.cornell.edu/catalog/ss:20988415" linktype="simple" xlink:show="new">Click for Image</extref></unittitle><container id="aspace_904ed2dd29707e619a36f010ecd4559e" label="unspecified" type="box">63</container><container id="aspace_5d8636d81195d0a0bebaa33f4cef0c15" parent="aspace_904ed2dd29707e619a36f010ecd4559e" type="folder">73</container></did></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_0e99e49c009528e54c1d5faae5026dc5" level="file"><did><unittitle>Southern Pacific El Paso Up Town Yards A-B-C and D and Yard Masters Tower Office</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1960/1960">1960</unitdate><container id="aspace_24e91d66b4aabd244a23c1b67ff30250" label="unspecified" type="box">63</container><container id="aspace_ad637362078cbb0113fc5d5985931172" parent="aspace_24e91d66b4aabd244a23c1b67ff30250" type="folder">74</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_704de8974832631c4d2f816848838d80"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The view overlooks the ice dock, which is in the right center portion of the picture, and the A and B yards which are to the left.

Engine No. 48 which is in center of the picture is on track No. 24 in C yard and approaching the C yard lead track which is straight track running up through the center of the picture. Towards the center background of the picture under the overpass, is a puzzle crossover which connects the C and D yards tracks together and into the D yard lead of tail track. These puzzle crossovers can be lined up in several directions: either across the tracks or up and down and because of the several directions in which the crossovers can be lined it is important to keep the under close observance. One of the duties of the fireman is to see that these switches are properly lined up. If they are not lined up and the engine proceeds through them, the crossover may be split or the engine derailed. If either of these events occur, delays in operation will follow. Note also here that the switch targets on the C yard lead track are on the engineer's side with respect to locomotive No. 48. These switch targets may be noted in the center of the picture running from the left bottom portion of the picture up through the center background. Although these targets are on the engineer's side, only the firemen on the left side of the locomotive, which would be your right as you look at the photograph, can observe other movements which may occur on other tracks in the C yard. The fact that the engineer's view of what is happening on the other side of the train is restricted is clear here; his view is obstructed not only by the hood of the locomotive, but also by the box cars ahead of it. The picture clearly shows the curvature of the track at the ice dock in the upper left hand portion of the picture. To the left of the ice dock and off the picture are the A and B yards.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_eeb00bdc1157d757b30fa2cde39f6c19" level="file"><did><unittitle>Item 1: <extref xlink:actuate="onrequest" xlink:href="https://digital.library.cornell.edu/catalog/ss:20988417" linktype="simple" xlink:show="new">Click for Image</extref></unittitle><container id="aspace_81484bf8f4f5fbeadc0f9a62ea40a45a" label="unspecified" type="box">63</container><container id="aspace_3fa47c2891a7beab9f2dbc412ba29e8f" parent="aspace_81484bf8f4f5fbeadc0f9a62ea40a45a" type="folder">75</container></did></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_b9a9d8d970304cf91f6e81d1aa141de3" level="file"><did><unittitle>Southern Pacific Uptown Yards A, B, C, and D</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1960/1960">1960</unitdate><container id="aspace_40df4781cc967742059a4a68cd9d2284" label="unspecified" type="box">63</container><container id="aspace_774ef27342f90f77ae82658bc95adb83" parent="aspace_40df4781cc967742059a4a68cd9d2284" type="folder">76</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_56785ffc3ccc452c360c39139b210b9b"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The view overlooks the ice dock, which is in the right center portion of the picture, and the A and B yards which are to the left.

These photographs were submitted to the Commission as Employees' Exhibit 33, are referred to by the letter S in testimony, and were taken by H. Pippy. Mr. Pippy was employed as a locomotive engineer and fireman by the Southern Pacific and was a member of the BLF&amp;E. The Southern Pacific was a class I railroad in the western United States. It covered a vast territory, with lines stretching from New Orleans through Texas, New Mexico and Arizona to Los Angeles; from Los Angeles up the West Coast through San Francisco and Sacramento to Portland, Oregon; from Chicago through St. Louis to Dallas and Ft. Worth, Texas; and from San Francisco through Nevada to Ogden, Utah. The Sunset Route, between New Orleans and Los Angeles, went through El Paso, Tucson and Phoenix, with a branch line heading south into Mexico at Nogales. The photographs in this series document the SP's facilities in Portland, Oregon. This includes the Brooklyn Yards, a 110-acre site located between Southeast Powell Boulevard and Bybee Boulevard. This series also contains photographs of Portland industries, the Steel Bridge, and Portland Union Station.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_07173c8b2012ff61798bfff05d7b06aa" level="file"><did><unittitle>SP Yard Engine Making Movement Across Steel Bridge</unittitle><container id="aspace_81a1ff33af277b34763eb0b7e9b10fc3" label="unspecified" type="box">55</container><container id="aspace_fc2f4399d65bc29394f6e411d4e93078" parent="aspace_81a1ff33af277b34763eb0b7e9b10fc3" type="folder">11</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_1cc6a98fde82b3a1d653c972dd21be96"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Yard engine coupled to transfer moving eastward from Brooklyn Yards to Northern Pacific Terminal Co Yard, Portland Union Station.

These photographs were submitted to the Commission as Employees' Exhibit 34, are referred to by the letter Q in testimony, and were taken by S. Vickers. Mr. Vickers was employed as a locomotive engineer by the Southern Pacific, and was a member of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, Division 161. The Southern Pacific was a class I railroad in the western United States. It covered a vast territory, with lines stretching from New Orleans through Texas, New Mexico and Arizona to Los Angeles; from Los Angeles up the West Coast through San Francisco and Sacramento to Portland, Oregon; from Chicago through St. Louis to Dallas and Ft. Worth, Texas; and from San Francisco through Nevada to Ogden, Utah. The Sunset Route, between New Orleans and Los Angeles, went through El Paso, Tucson and Phoenix, with a branch line heading south into Mexico at Nogales. This series documents the SP Passenger Yard and the Bayshore Yard, the main yard for the city of San Francisco. The photographs also document train movements over city streets at night and industries served by the SP in the San Francisco area.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_92f07f80db775f6c4998c3489fb689ee" level="file"><did><unittitle>RIP (Repair In Place) Track</unittitle><container id="aspace_bf0fc21613e5d40bd5504a434b89cb5b" label="unspecified" type="box">62</container><container id="aspace_67354aca614595a655b4968d17ff67f0" parent="aspace_bf0fc21613e5d40bd5504a434b89cb5b" type="folder">18</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_1df3551d39e09c72769ca09b7404a852"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Exhibit Q-2 shows the repair or rip track at the Bayshore yard.

Under such conditions, however, it is essential to have a fireman on the left hand side of the cab to advise the engineer of the clearances and any other train and vehicular traffic that may be approaching.

Cars are brought here from many points in San Francisco and are classified for distribution. At one end, known as the outbound, cuts of cars are switched. The lead that is used parallels the outgoing track for road freight trains. It curves into this track and to the left. Signals are given to the helper by ground crew until engineer is in sight.

Cars are brought here from many points in San Francisco and are classified for distribution. At one end, known as the outbound, cuts of cars are switched. The lead that is used parallels the outgoing track for road freight trains. It curves into this track and to the left. Signals are given to the helper by ground crew until engineer is in sight. Adjacent to the outbound lead, is the inbound lead which is used for switching incoming trains.

The Missouri Pacific Railroad gained majority ownership of the Texas and Pacific Railway's stock in 1928 but allowed it to continue operation as a separate entity. This series documents the T&amp;P facilities in El Paso, Texas, the industries it served, a view of the neighborhood around the train yard, and a view of the El Paso Union Depot. Of particular interest is the photograph of a streetcar which ran across the border between El Paso and Ciudad Juarez.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_03e1590fc35de9d87b022b7041172975" level="file"><did><unittitle>Texas &amp; Pacific Freight Yard Looking West</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1961/1961">1961</unitdate><container id="aspace_5f4906646f9c60792175f1bd9fcf6f8e" label="unspecified" type="box">53</container><container id="aspace_9cab167535aea67b6d8a3c9be4633fac" parent="aspace_5f4906646f9c60792175f1bd9fcf6f8e" type="folder">60</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_1a8b58f63be625f8320427ed7b4f6d46"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Shows the Texas and Pacific freight yard at El Paso,Texas.

These photographs were submitted to the Commission as Employees' Exhibit 42A, are referred to by the letter P in testimony, and were taken by Raymond Neupert. Mr. Neupert was employed as a locomotive fireman and engineman by the Terminal Railroad Association of St. Louis and was president of Lodge 21 of the BLF&amp;E. The TRRA is a switching and terminal railroad that handles traffic in the St. Louis, Missouri, metropolitan area. It is co-owned by several class I railroads that reach the city. The formation of the Terminal Railroad Association of St. Louis grew out of an agreement orchestrated by Mr. Jay Gould in 1889 between predecessor entities of the Terminal Railroad Association of St. Louis and six proprietary railroads. The Company was created for the purpose of securing to the various owners an efficient and economical method of interchanging passenger and freight traffic over the Mississippi River. The original railroads making up the Association were the Missouri Pacific Railway Company, the St. Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern Railway Company, Wabash Railroad Company, the Ohio and Mississippi Railway Company, the Louisville and Nashville Railroad Company, and the Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway Company. The photographs in this series document the yards and tracks in and around St. Louis Union Station, once the busiest train station in the world. The photographs in this series document the scope and intricacy of the operations in and around this station as well as some of the surrounding neighborhood.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_f823ba9c2d1d31a932d3ae16b6141804" level="file"><did><unittitle>18th Street Bridge, View to North West</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1961/1961">1961</unitdate><container id="aspace_fb18088e9efcd50fa819b3b494feb52e" label="unspecified" type="box">53</container><container id="aspace_d5b562b8fded4c4ebdeaaa48319e433b" parent="aspace_fb18088e9efcd50fa819b3b494feb52e" type="folder">3</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_c8c0cb091a1637bee76921bee90e43bb"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Movement of trains; three engines moving at same time.

This view is to the west from 16th Street. This is referred to as the 17th Street yard, or the mail, baggage, and express yards. There is very close clearance in this yard and all switches are called blind switches due to the fact that they have no lights. One of the blind switches is in the lower left center. The firemen must help observe the line-up on these switches. Upper center of photograph shows a workman walking around the end of a car. Personnel in and about this yard, and express on ramps (right center of photo) are a constant danger that must be observed by the engine crew in this yard to prevent many serious injuries.

At times there are 4 and 5 engines working in this yard at one time which necessitate two men on engine.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_3ed524ec6b3cf5103c5760821eb41b4b" level="file"><did><unittitle>Item 1: <extref xlink:actuate="onrequest" xlink:href="https://digital.library.cornell.edu/catalog/ss:20434299" linktype="simple" xlink:show="new">Click for Image</extref></unittitle><container id="aspace_2cc21f8f1bf7088d40f9aba76f1dfbd1" label="unspecified" type="box">58</container><container id="aspace_24f16102eaadd320d1587c466c4be58b" parent="aspace_2cc21f8f1bf7088d40f9aba76f1dfbd1" type="folder">24</container></did></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_cfd264a18b30128fead99386c067d419" level="file"><did><unittitle>View to the East from 18th Street Bridge</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1961/1961">1961</unitdate><container id="aspace_0bc4e32adea4c415616931fee1cc1d6f" label="unspecified" type="box">58</container><container id="aspace_3f30c92427285177948a3e0a45b499e7" parent="aspace_0bc4e32adea4c415616931fee1cc1d6f" type="folder">25</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_3da4d36dd6512461a81eab738c211b94"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Note engine working in upper right of photo crossing street with cars moving.

These photographs were submitted to the Commission as Employees' Exhibit 44, are referred to by the letter X in testimony, and were taken by Walter Shimel. Mr. Shimel was employed as both a fireman and engineer by the Union Pacific and a member of BLF&amp;E Lodge 77. The UP is a freight hauling railroad that operates 8,500 locomotives over 32,100 route-miles in 23 states west of Chicago and New Orleans. The Union Pacific Railroad system is the largest in the United States and it is one of the world's largest transportation companies. The photographs in this series were taken on November 15 and 16, 1960, and document yard operations in Denver, Colorado. Additionally, the photographs in this series document Denver neighborhoods around Denver Union Station, and in some case show similar locations to those found in Series VII.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_2ea305537b31d69249dace88311435d6" level="file"><did><unittitle>Bridges Over Cherry Creek</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1960/1960">1960</unitdate><container id="aspace_d90b95671cf58c7f965242847f9b3d8d" label="unspecified" type="box">59</container><container id="aspace_b86231716b2b4071d5dbae38a702a4ee" parent="aspace_d90b95671cf58c7f965242847f9b3d8d" type="folder">80</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_3cf2af6f6a43e76b2a169e0e10d5a50a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Counting left to right, bridge No. 4 has been removed and is not in service.

These photographs were submitted to the Commission as Employees' Exhibit 38, are referred to by the letter A in testimony, and were taken by Leo R. Anderson. Mr. Anderson was employed as a locomotive fireman by the WATC. The WATC is a corporation created in Washington D.C. to provide support to railroads using Washington's Union Station. It was established in 1901 by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and the Pennsylvania Railroad; Amtrak now owns the controlling interest. The photographs in this series document the tracks in and around Washington Union Station, showing the complexity of train movements in the area. The series also documents the Potomac Yards and the car shops at Ivy City.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_1f533c02f1bfbde069af79a7dd57c730" level="file"><did><unittitle>Railway Express Warehouse, Track 4</unittitle><container id="aspace_f65c92c6e17ddbc4c0258ff73dcdf438" label="unspecified" type="box">53</container><container id="aspace_0041d0a2a4e914c428a1d2c172bbc16b" parent="aspace_f65c92c6e17ddbc4c0258ff73dcdf438" type="folder">134</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_ae3edafaa1aa9a0242b946ae1b610690"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Northbound movement out of Track 4, Express Warehouse showing switch target and fixed signal.
