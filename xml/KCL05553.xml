    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>The Northern Pacific Railway Company [NP] built the Staples Station in 1909. It was designed by the same architectural firm, Reed and Stem, which designed the NP's King Street Station in Seattle, Washington and New York's Grand Central Terminal. The Staples depot and freight house were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. </p><p> The Staples Station served as a division point for the NP. As such, in additon to the passenger areas in the depot, the building housed office space for the trainmaster, superintendant, and other NP personnel who were responsible for overseeing NP operations in the neighboring train yards. The yards included a freight house, a round house, and repair in place tracks. Serving as a division point also meant that the Staples Station was where train crews would start and end their shifts, or even use overnight facilities provided for employees. </p><p> Due to its position as a division point, the correspondence of the trainmaster A. W. McClelland covers a wide variety of topics related to running a well-functioning train yard and station.</p>  </bioghist>
