<p>Founded in 1900 by local union delegates representing about 2,000 members in cities in the northeastern United States, the ILGWU grew in geographical scope, membership size, political influence to become one of the most powerful forces in American organized labor by mid-century. Representing workers in the women's garment industry, the ILGWU worked to improve working and living conditions of its members through collective bargaining agreements, training programs, health care facilities, cooperative housing, educational opportunities, and other efforts. In 1995, the ILGWU merged with the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union (ACTWU) to form the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees (UNITE).</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>The cloak industry in Chicago has a very long history, beginning with the organization of the Chicago Cloak Makers' Union in 1889. In August 1914, The Cloak Operators' Local 44, the Cloak Cutters' Local 81, and the Cloak Pressers' Local 18 united to form the Chicago Joint Board. Shortly thereafter, the new Joint Board achieved a collective agreement with the manufacturers' association in 1915, and continued to increase organizing efforts and minimum wage scales. Work hours were reduced from 50 to 44 a week and by 1919, week work was instituted for the cloak industry. The dressmakers of the city formed Local 100 in 1915, won a collective agreement with a 40 hour week in 1919, and in 1920 joined the Chicago Joint Board. At the end of 1920, disputes between the Chicago Joint Board and the Cloak Manufacturers' Association occurred, and in December 1921 there was a five week strike which resulted in the abolishment of week-work abolished and return to the 48 hour work week. The dress trade had an eighteen week general strike in 1924. Soon though, the Joint Board began to make gains, first with the introduction of the 40 hour week in the cloak shops in 1928, and then the two week strike in August 1933 won a collective agreement and 35 hour week for the dressmakers. </p><p> Morris Bialis served as the manager for the Chicago Joint Board beginning in 1922, and Morris A. Goldstein served as his long time secretary-treasurer. In December 1939, the Chicago cloakmakers', one of the oldest groups in the ILGWU, celebrated their fiftieth anniversary, and the Chicago Joint Board celebrated 25 years. During the 1940s, the Joint Board consisted of five locals, Locals 5 (Cloak Operators), 18 (Cloak and Dress Pressers), 59 (Cloak Finishers), 81 (Cloak and Dress Cutters), and 100 (Dressmakers), the encompassed the cloak and silk dress trades. In 1946, the Joint Board purchased a six story building in the Loop to continue to be an instrumental player in labor and community affairs of Chicago. </p><p> The Chicago Health Center was opened in 1955, and in 1957, Bialis, who had also been appointed director of the Midwest Region in 1934, was aided by assistant director Harold Schwartz. At the end of the 1950s and beginning of the 1960s, the numbers of retirees increased the need for new workers to maintain payments of benefits in the face of a shrinking garment industry in Chicago. As the Chicago market continued to decline through the 1960s and union membership decreased, by 1974, Local 18 and 59 merged with Local 5, Local 54 merged with Local 76, and Local 208 and 212 merged with Local 261. After 54 years of service, Morris Bialis retired from his role as Joint Board manager in February 1976 (he had been elected an ILGWU vice-president in 1928). Harold Schwartz became the new manager of the Joint Board, as well as Midwest Region director, and Lou Montenegro named assistant director. In November 1978, Schwartz announced his retirement and assistant director Lou Montenegro was elected to succeed him as the regional manager as well as the manager of the Chicago Joint Board. As Chicago saw a rise in sweatshops during the 1980s, Montenegro led the Joint Board.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The records of the Chicago Joint Board are composed of two series: General Correspondence and Subject Files. These files not only provide information on the garment industry in the city of Chicago, but the correspondence and documents also present a picture of the smaller markets, such as rural Indiana and northern Michigan, including the small shops, manufacturers and local workers. The correspondence is arranged by city, many of which are within the Midwest Region that encompassed Chicago and the Joint Board. The records contain matters pertaining to shops in the smaller Midwest towns and include correspondence from organizers regarding shops and strikes, organizing campaigns, and often times resistance from employers and employees. Also well documented are the markets in bigger cities such as Decatur, Detroit, Grand Rapids, Indianapolis, and Peoria, and the records of the Milwaukee Joint Board (Locals 188, 273, 292, 322 and 334). Resistance to organizing in the shops of the small towns and rural areas is illustrated through union promotional material including flyers, leaflets, newsletters, and booklets extolling the virtues of joining the union. </p><p> The second component of the collection consists of subject files. The records include very early reports and correspondence; campaign to preserve Jane Addams Hull House; letters and photos from children "adopted" by the Joint Board that they financially supported after the war; hearings and case decisions that were brought before an impartial tribunal over disputes and complaints between the union, manufacturer associations (such as the Chicago Association of Dress Manufacturers), and individuals. Additionally, various departments within the national ILGWU structure that the Chicago Joint Board and its locals had business with are represented including the departments of auditing, research, political, management-engineering, education, and union label. Notable individuals in the series include Morris Bialis, David Dubinsky, Morris A. Goldstein (secretary-treasurer of the Chicago Joint Board), Frederick Umhey, Abraham Plotkin, Harold Schwartz (assistant director Midwest Department,1959-1966), and Louis Stulberg. </p><p> Of particular importance are the minutes of the Joint Board, beginning with 1914 which is in Yiddish, as well as the minutes of the various health and welfare funds, which also include reports agreements, and charters, by-laws. The subject files also provide documentation on the locals that comprised the Joint Board. There are Chicago Locals publications including, "The Needle," "Good News," which was published by the Educational Department of Locals 76 and 261, "Our Aim," the official organ of Local 91, and "Our Voice," published by the Chicago Joint Board. </p><p> The collection offers an interesting location to find information on the history of the Chicago area and garment industry, which are available in the reports submitted to "Justice." These provide summaries from Chicago and news from the Midwest Department, including updates on Michigan and Indiana. The collection also provides a status for the Chicago cloak and dress industry, as well as the Midwest, particularly useful through the reports submitted to the ILGWU General Executive Board. </p><p> There are also reports and correspondence from the Midwest Department, of which the Joint Board was a part of, but also see Midwest Region Records 5780/101. </p><p> Locals represented in the records of the Chicago Joint Board include: 67 (Toledo, OH),90 (Elgin, IL), 120 (Decatur, IL), 133 (Peoria, IL), 187 (Racine, WI), 189 (Batavia, IL), 238 (Gary, IN), 240 (Aurora, IL), 272 (Gilman, IL), 277 (Indianapolis, IN), 286 (Ishpeming, MI), 293 (Marquette and Negaunee), 317 (Bay City, MI), 328 (Kokomo, IN) 337 (Elkhart, IN), 354 (Alpena, MI), 355 (Clinton, IA), 355 (Manistee, MI), 364 (Port Huron, MI), 380 (Shelbyville, IN), 382 (Lincoln, IL), 392 (Logansport, IN), 441 (Kalamazoo, MI), 489 (Kendallville, IN), 508 (Mauston, WI).</p>  </scopecontent>
