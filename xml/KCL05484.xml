    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>The RLEA was founded in 1926 in response to the passage of the Railway Labor Act. Prior to 1926, there had been an informal association between the railroad labor organizations so that the various chief executives of the different unions could work together to form a unified course of action that would benefit all of their members. This group became more formalized immediately after the end of WW1. The U.S. railroads had been nationalized as part of the war effort, and the railroad labor organizations wanted them to remain under federal management, both because of increased productivity and because of better labor relations with the industry. The effort was ultimately unsuccessful, and the railroads returned to private industry; however, the railroad labor organizations had realized the need to have a united front to counter the carriers and industry groups and lobbyists. </p><p> On May 18, 1926, the chief executives of the railroad labor organization met in Washington D.C., formalized their association with By-Laws, and elected officers to serve the newly created RLEA. The original purpose, codified in the original preamble, was co-operative action to obtain and develop consistent interpretations and utilization of the Railway Labor Act. The RLEA was comprised of the chief executives of the 21 railroad labor unions, including the president of the Railway Employees' Department of the AFL, and each member got one vote, regardless of the size of their union. The organization was voluntary, so no member organization was bound by its decisions. Over the course of its existence, various member organizations withdrew and then re-affiliated with the RLEA. </p><p> From 1926 to 1938, the RLEA did not maintain an office, but the amount of work and its importance led the RLEA to open an office in Washington DC and employ a full-time Executive Secretary-Treasurer to run it. The RLEA did not engage in collective bargaining itself, but rather lobbied on behalf of its member organizations, securing such achievements as the Railroad Retirement Act and limiting unemployment for its members during the Great Depression. The RLEA's various areas of interest, such as retirement, safety, legal matters, were broken down into committees, each of which reported back to the executive board on the steps being taken in those areas. </p><p> Post WW2, the RLEA played a central role in the Marshall Plan, working with non-Communist labor organizations in Western Europe to establish labor policy and also assist in the work of rebuilding the European railroads. The RLEA was also a major factor in international labor union federations, and its decision to affiliate with the International Transport Workers' Federation (ITF) and to encourage the ITF not to join with the Soviet affiliated World Federation of Trade Unions was seen as a major victory for the west. </p><p> The RLEA, like its member organizations, did not allow African-American members. As such, it was only representing the interests of white railroad employees; black railroad employees were forced, for the most part, to work without recognized union protection. The exception to this was the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters (BSCP), who in 1948 began a series of successful legal challenges to the jurisdictions over various classes of work. As BSCP's successes in the courts mounted up, and the RLEA's member unions and the RLEA itself were being sued for discriminatory practices, the RLEA finally capitulated in 1950, and accepted the BSCP as a member organization. </p><p> In 1950, the RLEA joined with the AFL, CIO, and International Association of Machinists to form the United Labor Policy Committee. This committee oversaw the labor representatives of the Wage Stabilization Board. </p><p> In the latter half of the 20th century, the importance of the RLEA declined alongside the decline in the railroad industry itself. As its member unions either merged into single entities or disaffiliated from the RLEA its influence waned, as did the number of its members. The RLEA attempted to counter this decline with the purchase of a railroad at least three different times in the 1970s and 1980s, though they were ultimately unsuccessful in this venture. Ongoing internal battles between the remaining chief executives of the railroad unions further weakened the RLEA until in 1997 it disbanded, handing over its responsibilities to the newly formed AFL-CIO Transportation Trades Department.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>Inclusive date range: 1926-1976 </p><p> Bulk dates: 1930-1967 </p><p> This collection consists of the office files of the Railway Labor Executives' Association for the years 1930 through 1967 and select general and subject files for 1926 through 1976. The files are arranged in 14 series. Using the RLEA's File Guides (see collections 5552 and 5728), every effort has been made to arrange the records according to the original filing system for the Office Files (series II X). The RLEA arranged their records chronologically by year in designated record groups. These record groups are used for each calendar year. Each record group consists of numerous files, the majority of which are maintained from year to year. Only when the executive council removed a particular issue from their monthly meeting agendas, records related to that issue were removed from the record group. </p><p> Additionally, the RLEA filed their records with pages from the Agendas of their monthly meetings, annotated with the meeting minutes on that particular issue. As a result, the files themselves contain individual guides to the records contained in them. Agenda pages are not found in every file in this collection, for example neither correspondence files nor files containing printed pamphlets of legislation contain agenda pages, but the majority of the files possess this additional guide to the records. </p><p> This collection contains correspondence, court case reports, court decisions, legal filings, executive orders, reports of emergency boards, statistics, copies of legislation, political records, arbitration and mediation records, financial statements and labor agreements. Also found are foreign language newspapers, photographs, government documents, maps, time tables, merger proceedings, blueprints for office buildings, schematics for railroad facilities, and statistical data for the railroad industry. </p><p> This collection also contains extensive documentation of the Marshall Plan, the reconstruction of post-World War II Europe, mobilization of America's railroads during World War II, the Railroad Merger Era, and the beginning of the decline of the railroad industry post 1960.</p>  </scopecontent>

It also contains financial records, assessments of its member organizations, correspondence files for each of those organizations, correspondence files of various RLEA executives including executive-secretary Arlen E. Lyon, president C.E. Leighty, chairman James A. Phillips., and chairman George Harrison. Also found are correspondence files inviting unaffiliated railway labor union organizations to join the RLEA, records relating to the creation of the Washington DC office and the full-time salaried position of RLEA Executive-Secretary, and files covering the minutiae of running an office and lobbying Congress. </p><p>  Of particular interest in this series are the files documenting the U.S. railroad industry during World War II. As the lobbying and policy advisory organization for organized railroad labor, the RLEA was intimately involved in many aspects of supply and logistics on the home front during World War II. The records for the Office of Defense Transportation (ODT), the War Assets Administration, the War Department, the War Manpower Commission, and the Office of Defense Manpower Management-Labor Policy Committee all provide an extensive in-depth look at how the railroad industry functioned during war time, and how labor and the RLEA negotiated and lobbied to protect their members even as they sought to serve the national interest. These records also offer a picture of the size and power of the American railroad industry during its height of influence and reach. </p><p>  Of particular interest in the files from World War II and the immediate postwar period are the records of what was colloquially known as the Bracero Program. This program, managed by the State Department, the Department of Labor, and the War Manpower Commission, imported Mexican nationals to work in the U.S. as guest workers, both in agriculture and on the railroad where there were severe work force shortages. The program was started in 1942 when the United States and Mexico both signed the Mexican Farm Labor Agreement, and was extended with the Migrant Labor Agreement of 1951. This program was not popular with Labor, and the RLEA kept extensive files on the program. Even after the railroad portion of the Bracero Program ended in 1945, they continued to monitor the agricultural portion with representatives from National Farm Labor Union, AFL-CIO, including Ernesto Galarza, until 1959. The Bracero Program officially ended in 1964. The manpower crisis during the war encouraged the carriers to look to other sources of labor. This included proposals from various carriers to make use of interned Japanese-Americans as a source of cheap and ready labor. The RLEA quickly blocked that plan, claiming the risk of sabotage from these citizens (referred to as "Aliens" in the correspondence) was too great. The carriers also suggested employing prisoners of war, but were met with even greater opposition. Neither plan was put into effect. Additionally, in the files on the Bracero Program, there is correspondence in regards to the employment of African-Americans on the railroads, and how the use of Mexican nationals was negatively affecting their wages and chances of employment in an industry in which they were already subject to extensive discrimination from both labor and management. Finally, there are also files regarding the employment of women on the railroads, which include guidelines determining in which crafts women could be employed. </p><p>  The RLEA was also deeply involved in various postwar activities, both on the home front and abroad. Records in this series document the massive amount of trains and cars needed to move returning veterans from their disembarkation ports to their homes. There is also extensive documentation of the efforts to employee veterans in the railroad industry or to aid veterans in returning to their previous jobs on the railroads without loss of seniority or position. </p><p>  Abroad, the RLEA played a major role in the implementation of the Marshall Plan. The records of the Economic Cooperation Administration and the Mutual Security Administration located in this series document the rebuilding of European railroads and the intimate relations between the European railroad labor organizations with their American counterparts. On a personal level, the records on European nations in the "Foreign" subject heading contain letters from European railroadmen, writing for help from their American brothers. Some of these files, like the one on Greece, contain photographs of these men and their families. The RLEA and its member organizations spearheaded food and clothing drives and other charitable endeavors to aid people as best they could. On a national level, the records in the files on foreign countries and on the implementation of the Marshall Plan also contain detailed reports on the state of the various nations, the state of the railroad industry, and of labor. In particular, there is extensive reporting on Soviet, communist, and communist suspected influences in the various locations in which the RLEA had contacts and agents working on their behalf. These types of reports are not limited to European nations. The RLEA was also a major component of the United States' foreign policy in Central and South America. Their membership in the Pan-American Railway Congress was by appointment of the president and facilitated through the State Department. Additionally, it was this connection with the State Department that facilitated foreign worker exchange programs, where railroaders from other nations would come to the U.S. to study the American railroad industry. This series also contains records about the activities of communists in America, including select records of the House Un-American Committee. </p><p>  The beginning of the RLEA's role in international labor as discussed above in the organization history is documented in this series. There are extensive records created by the International Transport Workers' Federation including minutes of committee meetings, constitutions, reports on conference proceedings, and reports on trips to these conferences. There is also extensive correspondence between RLEA Chief Executives and their agents and counterparts in various sovereign nations. </p><p>  This series also contains documentation of the railroad industry in America. Statistics on all aspects of the industry, recorded by the ICC, are located in this series as are reports from the Department of Labor. Also found are extensive files on proposed legislation and enacted laws that are related to either the railroad industry or to the labor movement in America. (N.B.: For additional records on railroad legislation, see series XI). This series contains decisions by the National Mediation Board (NMB) and the National Railroad Adjustment Board (NRAB) determining which organizations have the legal right under the Railway Labor Act to represent classes of employees on different roads. There are also records on the implementation of the Union Shop provision of the Railway Labor Act and various amendments to that portion of the bill. Other areas documented include State level legislation, the building of pipelines and other means of transporting fuel, transportation of goods on waterways, and the passage of the Workman's Compensation Act. The records of various National Wage Movements may also be found in this series. </p><p>  Finally, this series contains legal filing by the RLEA in front of U.S. District Courts and the Supreme Court of the United States. Many of these cases established precedents for the implementation and adjudication of the complex and extensive laws and statutes governing the railroad industry and its labor practices. Slocum established that an employee may only seek redress from the NRAB except in the narrow case of common-law wrongful discharge, which was contra to previous interpretations. This decision was affirmed by Southern Railway v. Order of Railway Conductors. This decision remained in force until a public law was passed in 1966 to address the massive backlog of cases at the NRAB. The Supreme Court was also the body that overrode the ICC when it made decisions that failed to punish carriers for violating federal anti-discrimination laws, as was the case in Mitchell v. Rock Island Railroad.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_8c7229a617e3a4fbe7748b23c6ab6517" level="file"><did><unittitle>Addresses, Miscellaneous</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1935/1945" type="inclusive">1935-1945</unitdate><container id="aspace_7f1f99681517aeef2d6ada88d0c6c813" label="unspecified [31924079244731]" type="box">1</container><container id="aspace_cd379bab805058c0f4d3c699e3bb2e60" parent="aspace_7f1f99681517aeef2d6ada88d0c6c813" type="folder">1</container></did></c02><c02 id="aspace_185c84166fa9e353164739a92eb50d52" level="file"><did><unittitle>American-European Railroad Relief</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1943/1945" type="inclusive">1943-1945</unitdate><container id="aspace_8a363dfb837e227e5b4bcf77abba98d3" label="unspecified [31924079244731]" type="box">1</container><container id="aspace_a83309dd37d621de6f69ff124e58ded0" parent="aspace_8a363dfb837e227e5b4bcf77abba98d3" type="folder">2</container></did></c02><c02 id="aspace_aca61dd107f8f741ca529807aab6c31a" level="file"><did><unittitle>American-European Relief: Sweden, V.J.

Like the files in series I, these records were stored as inactive records; however, these files were kept in their active filing order. The files are arranged in the original RLEA file structure and ordered chronologically under each file name. The files are divided into 7 record groups: Government, Legislation, Other Organizations, Court Cases, International Affairs, RLEA, and General Files. </p><p>  Of note in the Government Record group are the records of the Mutual Security Agency, which was responsible for the administration of the Marshall Plan. Also of note in this record group is the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) study on the deficit in passenger trains, the files on the Bracero program, and the files on the State Department, including the records of the Pan-American Railway Congress. In the Legislation Record group, the records of the Congressional Hearing on the Railroad Situation address the growing problems in the industry. This is also apparent in the General Records Group, which contains files on growing commuter problems in urban areas. </p><p>  Also of interest are the plans for the Railway Labor Building in Washington DC, which include blueprints and photographs of the site as the building was constructed.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_5370f396939b777fb069f66717676755"

They are arranged into seven record groups: Government, Legislation, Judicial, RLEA, Railroads, Other Organizations, International Affairs, and Commuter Problems. </p><p>  Of particular note in this series are the records documenting the start of the Florida East Coast Railway Strike. This strike, which lasted from 1964 until 1974, was one of the longest strikes in modern American labor history. The RLEA documented the strike each year, and additional records may be located in collections 5552 and 5728. </p><p>  Also of note are the files concerning the passage of the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964, which started to address the failing infrastructure and need for capital improvements to existing urban mass transportation systems.</p></scopecontent><c02

Contents</head><p>This series consists of the Office Files of the RLEA for the year 1965. They are arranged into seven record groups: Government, Legislation, Judicial, RLEA, Railroads, Other Organizations, International Affairs, and Commuter Problems. </p><p>  Of note in this series are the files on the Bank Holding Company Act, which substantively changed the laws with regard to mergers and acquisitions among corporate entities. Also of note are the studies of the problems on the New Haven Line along the Northeast Corridor. </p><p>  This series is also the first to contain numerous files that were never used by the RLEA, a trend that would continue as the railroad industry and its labor organizations began to wane in importance and size.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_d4bc42eeed8575ac4649642ea0d93638"

id="aspace_d7b7c6be5121a5f16cf289c78b114088"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This series consists of the records of government legislation and policy that pertained to or affected the railroad industry. The RLEA was initially founded in response to the passing of the Railway Labor Act, and throughout its existence, one of its primary missions was to lobby on behalf of railroad labor in the U.S. government and to help shape and guide policy for the railroad industry. The records in this series document that effort as well as the final results of those efforts in the form of laws, regulations, safety standards, employee protections, unemployment insurance, retirement funds, and other social safety nets. </p><p> The legislation that was most germane to the RLEA's missions, the Railway Labor Act, is located in this series Also included are amendments to the Act, records of Congressional subcommittees that held hearings in regards to the Act and its implementation, extensive correspondence between the RLEA chiefs and with members of Congress, and extensive documentation of Labor-Management Committees that served in a variety of functions including on the Wage Stabilization Boards established during the Korean War to protect labor's interests in wartime. The RLEA's involvement in negotiating national wage standards is also documented in the records of Emergency Boards that are located in this series. </p><p>  The Railroad Retirement and Unemployment Acts are also extensively documented in this series, as is the Railroad Retirement Board (RRB). The RRB is the federal agency that oversees the implementation of the provisions of the Railroad Retirement and Unemployment Acts. Railroad employees have a separate retirement system from Social Security; this system also administers supplemental pensions, Medicare, disability, and unemployment benefits for railroad employees. This system predates Social Security, and was used as a model for that system. Documentation of the passage of the Social Security Act may also be found in this series. </p><p>  Of particular note is the correspondence file tracking the passage of the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act through both houses of Congress to President Roosevelt's desk where it was signed into law in 1938. </p><p>  Finally, this series contains the speeches and testimonies of RLEA Chief Executives before various Congressional bodies, legislation concerning railroad safety, legislation concerning ground transportation regulations, and studies on the organization and procedures of the Interstate Commerce Committee (ICC).</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_4a5907ca2e8e7dc44b47ae4cd477aada" level="file"><did><unittitle>Railroad Retirement Act: Disqualification of Employees Within

The ICC was the governmental body that regulated the railroads from its inception in 1887 until it was abolished in 1995. One of the areas of the railroad industry that the ICC oversaw was the ability of the carriers to consolidate, enter into mergers, abandon lines, or acquire new properties. Any of these activities had to first be approved by the ICC. A decision could only be reached after a series of hearings and negotiations between the various corporate entities, railroad labor representatives, and any other interested parties. The proceeding could take years, and produced voluminous records. </p><p>  The records in this series consist of the filings before the ICC by both the carriers and by railroad labor organizations. Also found are filings by states and municipalities that had a stake in the outcome of any decision. Expert witnesses, such as economists, labor scholars, and railroad industry experts, provided extensive testimony before the ICC, transcripts of which are also found in this series. </p><p>  These records extensively document what is sometimes referred to as the Railroad Merger Era, in which American railroads, suffering a sudden decline in profits because of the rise of the interstate highway system, reduced reliance on coal, and other factors, sought to consolidate in an effort to remain competitive. This period is generally considered to begin with the merger between Norfolk and Western and the Virginian Railway in 1959 and peaked in 1968 with the merger of the Pennsylvania Railroad, the New York Central Railroad, and the New York, New Haven, and Hartford Railroad into the Penn Central Transportation Company. The records of both of these mergers are located in this series. </p><p>  The records in this series also include the mergers of the Wabash Railroad and New York, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad (Nickel Plate Road) into the Norfolk and Western, forming a successful company that served 14 States and regions of Canada. The records of the merger between the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and the Erie with the Delaware, Lackawanna, and Hudson may also be found in this series. </p><p>  The records of the Penn Central merger are of particular interest. The Pennsylvania Railroad and the New York Central had been rivals, operating in the same areas of the country, since their inceptions. However, due to numerous financial considerations in the postwar era, the two companies began to discuss the possibility of a merger in the late 1950s. As a result of the freight traffic they handled as well as the passenger service both carriers operated into the major metropolitan centers of the East Coast, the ICC requirements for the merger, as well as the objections of labor organizations, rival carriers, and the concerns of the municipal governments, the merger took over a decade to be approved. The two companies merged in 1968, and as a requirement to the merger imposed by the ICC, they also absorbed the New Haven Railroad in 1969. The new carrier was called the Penn Central Transportation Company. In 1970, the Penn Central declared bankruptcy. This was the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history until the 2001 Enron bankruptcy. Extensive documentation of the merger proceedings are located in this series. The records of the bankruptcy may be found in Collections 5552 and 5728. </p><p>  Other major attempted mergers of note that are documented in this series are the ultimately unsuccessful attempt by the Chicago and North Western to acquire the Rock Island Railroad (Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad) and the proposed merger between the Union Pacific and Rock Island. This merger, which would have created a mega-system between Chicago and the West Coast, led to numerous objections being filed by other carriers. The proposed merger between the UP and the Rock Island resulted in 10 years of hearings in front of the ICC and voluminous filings by carriers, experts, labor organizations, and various state and local entities. It was also one of the most complicated cases ever heard before the ICC. The merger ultimately proved unsuccessful because at the end of the process, the Rock Island had lost too much value through discontinuance of lines and lack of repairs and maintenance on its rolling stock and facilities. In 1974, the ICC approved the merger but the UP withdrew its offer because the cost had become prohibitive. The Rock Island entered bankruptcy in 1975, and went out of business in 1980. </p><p>  Also of interest are the numerous applications by various railroads for the discontinuance of passenger services. The majority of railroad profits were made from freight haulage, and many lines sought to rid themselves of unprofitable passenger lines, many times to the detriment of the communities these lines served. This, in combination with the Penn Central merger and bankruptcy and the bankruptcies of other major carriers, led to the Northeast Rail Crisis and the federal government's creation of Amtrak. (See Collections 5552 and 5728 for the RLEA files on these subjects.)</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_a6d1450a903f059fe350fb844bba150d" level="file"><did><unittitle>Mergers: New York Central and

Contents</head><p>The Washington Job Protection Agreement (WJPA), also known as the Agreement of 1936, was a collective bargaining agreement entered into by the carriers and the railroad labor organizations. Its creation was in reaction to the ICC's determination in 1935 that it could approve or deny railroad mergers based on how the consolidation of two carriers might adversely affect protected employees. The WJPA ensured that financial compensation would be offered to railroad employees who lost their jobs or saw a reduction in earning as the result of a carrier merger, or as the result of the coordination of railroad facilities, operations, or services. The WJPA also created procedures to protect seniority rights, place of work, moving expenses, and compensation for loss in the sale of property. </p><p>  The records in this series contain the conferences and committee proceedings between carriers and various railroad labor organizations that occurred when conditions outlined in the WJPA's Section 13 were met. It is worth noting that a large number of these proceeding occurred as a direct result of the numerous railroad mergers that are documented in Series XII. </p><p>  This series also contains records of various amendments made to the WJPA and of the negotiations that created those amendments. </p><p>  Of particular interest are the minutes of the conferences held by the carriers conferences and the RLEA in February 1936. These minutes document the final steps of negotiations between labor and management prior to the signing of the Agreement in May 1936. An annotated penultimate draft of the WJPA is also found in this series.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_f52bcf6f79175c1d682523bb99b03009" level="file"><did><unittitle>Washington Job Protection
