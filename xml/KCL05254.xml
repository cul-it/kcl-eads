<p>Local industrial union councils operated on a city, county, or district basis and were composed of the CIO local unions within these areas. The industrial union councils were under the control of the CIO, but the CIO did not force its nationals and internationals to make their local unions join the local councils. The Local councils, like the state councils, were coordinating agencies designed to serve the local unions within their area.</p><p> "The objects of the Council shall be to secure united action of all locals of national and international unions and organizing committees and local industrial unions and industrial union councils affiliated to the CIO within its jurisdiction and through united action to protect, maintain and advance the interests of all working people in its territory, to extend unionism on the basis of industrial organization, to secure and enforce legislation in the interests of the working people, to promote recognition and acceptance of collective bargaining in industry, and to increase public understanding of the labor movement."</p><p> -CIO Model Constitution</p><p> The Greater Buffalo Industrial Union Council was organized in 193T. The council participated in organizing work and engaged in politics: municipal, state and national. It tried to cultivate a favorable public opinion toward CIO unions. The council sometimes engaged in various types of educational work, such as forming study classes and encouraged the formation of education committees in local unions.</p>  </bioghist>
