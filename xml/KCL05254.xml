<p>Local industrial union councils operated on a city, county, or district basis and were composed of the CIO local unions within these areas. The industrial union councils were under the control of the CIO, but the CIO did not force its nationals and internationals to make their local unions join the local councils. The Local councils, like the state councils, were coordinating agencies designed to serve the local unions within their area.</p><p> "The objects of the Council shall be to secure united action of all locals of national and international unions and organizing committees and local industrial unions and industrial union councils affiliated to the CIO within its jurisdiction and through united action to protect, maintain and advance the interests of all working people in its territory, to extend unionism on the basis of industrial organization, to secure and enforce legislation in the interests of the working people, to promote recognition and acceptance of collective bargaining in industry, and to increase public understanding of the labor movement."</p><p> -CIO Model Constitution</p><p> The Greater Buffalo Industrial Union Council was organized in 193T. The council participated in organizing work and engaged in politics: municipal, state and national. It tried to cultivate a favorable public opinion toward CIO unions. The council sometimes engaged in various types of educational work, such as forming study classes and encouraged the formation of education committees in local unions.</p>  </bioghist>

These include proposed new or amended federal, state, or county legislation and public issues of interest to organized labor. Among the issues acted upon were the Hatch-Ball-Burton Bill, S.1171; a national health bill; the Taft-Hartley Act, the St. Lawrence power project; time-and-a-half provisions for county workers; and the imposition of state sales tax in New York. The GBIUC also expressed its opinion on the issues of runaway shops, social security, unemployment, a guaranteed annual wage, slum clearance and low rent housing, World War II defense issues, and the anti-communist campaign of the 1950's, among others. </p><p> The collection contains files relating to the Council's relations with its member organizations, including correspondence, reports, resolutions, surveys, legislative materials, and publications (1939-1959).
