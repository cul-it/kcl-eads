    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Sanford E. Thompson, construction engineer, scientific management practitioner, and consultant, is best known for his application of Frederick W. Taylor's principles of scientific management to various construction and manufacturing problems, in an effort to develop accurate methods of management planning. Born on February 13, 1867 in Ogdensburg, NY, he graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where he studied civil engineering and chemistry. He held several positions as engineer and superintendent of construction at a variety of plants until 1896, when he started consulting work. Between 1917 and his death in 1949 he was a partner in the Thompson and Lichtner Company, a management and engineering consulting firm. Thompson also served in a number of governmental posts between 1921 and 1943.</p>  </bioghist>
