<p>On October 18, 1945, Mayor O'Dwyer of New York City suggested that the use of collective bargaining might alleviate the friction between the Board of Transportation and the transit employees. It was not until 1950, however, when Michael J. Quill, President of the Transport Workers Union, demanded immediate contract negotiations with the Board of Transportation, that this issue came to the forefront. Quill had circulated a petition among the transit workers calling for these negotiations, and claimed that 21,834 of the 27,000 employees had supported his stand. </p><p> Other T.W.U. demands were a $2-a-day raise for all transit employees, increased overtime pay, an improved pension plan, and additional vacation days after five years of service. The Greater New York CIO requested that the present grievance procedure of the BoT be modified. Conversely, the BoT argued that it did not have the funds to meet these demands. Mayor O'Dwyer offered to set up a fact-finding board to hear the complaints of each side, and both the Board of Transportation and the Transport Workers Union agreed to submit their cases before this impartial board. </p><p> The Board was appointed by Mayor William O'Dwyer on January 9, 1950. David L. Cole was appointed as chairman of the Board, and Theodore W. Kheel, Thomas A. Morgan, and Edward P. Mulrooney were appointed as Board members. The hearings began on April 12, 1950. </p><p> The findings of the Board may be found in its printed <extref xlink:href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=coo.31924002357584;view=1up;seq=1;size=175">Report to Honorable William O'Dwyer, Mayor of the City of New York, May 31, 1950</extref>.</p>  </bioghist>
