    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>U.S. Emergency Board No. 114 was convened in November of 1955 to settle the dispute engendered by the request of the Cooperating (Non-operating) Railroad Labor Organizationis to the Albany Port District Railroad and other carriers represented by the Eastern, Western, and Southeastern Carriers' Conference Committees that the latter ay the full cost of hospital, medical and surgical insurance and that they grant an increase of 25 cents per hour to all existing rates of pay. </p><p> After one month's deliberation, the Board recommended a fourteen and one-half cent increase and that the carriers assume and pay the full cost of the named health insurance. </p><p> On April 1, 1955 the Organizations gave 30 days notice of a wish to modify the provisions of a memorandum of August 21, 1954 which established a contributory health and welfare program. The Organizations wished the Carriers to pay the full cost of the program. </p><p> On August 1, 1955 the Organizations submitted an additional notice calling for an across-the-board pay increase of $.25 per hour. No agreement could be reached, as the Carriers believed the first issue was not for discussion, and their offer of a $.105 wage increase was declined. </p><p> On September 15, 1955 the Organizations began circulating a strike ballot among the employees they represented. The National Mediation Board stepped in, and unable to achieve agreement offered arbitration which was turned down by the Organizations. </p><p> On November 7, 1955 the President issued an executive order establishing the Emergency Board consisting of Dudley E. Whiting, Chairman, G. Allen Dash, Jr., member, and John Day Larkin, member. Hearings were held in Chicago from November 9 to November 30. The Board also met with the parties separately in an attempt to help them reach an agreement, but they were unsuccessful. The report to the President was submitted on December 12, 1955.</p>  </bioghist>
