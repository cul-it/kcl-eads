    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Paul Abelson, the son of Joseph Mayer and Ruchama (Bromber) Abelson was born in Kovno, Lithuania, September 27, 1878. He immigrated to the United States with his parents in 1892. He received his A.B. from the College of the City of New York in 1899, his secondary diploma from the Teacher's College of Columbia University in 1900, and his Ph.D. from Columbia University in 1906. In 1918, he received his L.L.B. from the New York Law School and was admitted to the New York Bar. </p><p> Mr. Abelson's career was most closely connected with the labor movement. In 1910, he entered the field of labor arbitration when he was appointed a member of the conciliation staff under the arbitration plan of the cloak and suit industry of New York City. </p><p> Throughout his career, he continued to serve as a labor arbitrator for many other industries including: the paper box industry, the hosiery industry, the fur, millinery, men's hat, Jewish baking, and jewelry trades. After the passage of the National Recovery Act in 1933, Abelson was appointed by President Roosevelt as government representative on seven apparel trade boards. </p><p> Abelson was a founder of the National Academy of Arbitrators and while alive was regarded as the Dean of that organization. </p><p> Abelson also served as a member of the National Panel of Arbitrators of the American Arbitration Association. </p><p> He contributed numerous articles on labor, education, and civics to various magazines. He was editor-in-chief of the English-Yiddish Encyclopedia Dictionary (1915); The Dictionary of Fur Names (1921); and the author of The Seven Liberal Arts (1906), a study in medieval education. </p><p> Paul Abelson was married in 1905, to Helen Cohen in New York City. They had three children (Miriam [Mrs. Robert Ness], Ruth [Mrs. Harold Ceder], and Louise) and eight grandchildren. On November 4, 1953, he died in New York City at the age of 75.</p>  </bioghist>
