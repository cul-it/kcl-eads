    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>The Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen [BRT] was founded in 1883 in Oneonta, N.Y. as a protective and insurance organization. It was established to represent members' interests in obtaining a satisfactory contract with management. The first Canadian lodge was established in Moncton, New Brunswick in 1885, and the first Ladies' Auxiliary was organized in Fort Gratiot, Michigan in 1889 by Sophia Granger, wife of Henry Granger, treasurer of St. Clair Lodge 241, with the support of the wives, sisters, and mothers of the St. Clair Lodge members. </p><p> The purpose of the organization was to promote social interaction and mutual aid among the spouses of operating railroad workers in this craft. The rail service members of the BRT included conductors and their assistants, dining car stewards, ticket collectors, train baggagemen, brakemen, and train flagmen. The yard service members of the BRT included yardmasters, yard conductors, switchtenders, foremen, flagmen, brakemen, switchmen, car tenders, operators, hump riders, and car operators. </p><p> In 1969, the BRT merged with three other railroad labor unions to form the United Transportation Union [UTU]. The Ladies' Auxiliary was granted its new charter from the UTU in 1970.</p>  </bioghist>
