    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>After the conclusion of a twenty-six day strike by the workers on the LIRR, the BRT and its officers filed suit against the LIRR, the AAR, and other ssociated corporate entities, alleging that sometime prior to 1959, the vice-president in charge of the law department of the AAR met with designated representatives of the other railroad defendants, including the LIRR, to create a pool of their assets and earnings for the purpose of assisting any participating member which might be affected by a work stoppage or strike. The plaintiffs argued that this artificially strengthened the economic bargaining position of individual railroad companies in collective bargaining with unions. </p><p> The BRT and its officers contended that the costs the union incurred during the strike, which was prompted by the failure of collective bargaining and mediation proceedings between the LIRR and the BRT in 1959-1960 to establish a five day work week without a reduction in pay for the LIRR's employees, were a result of the LIRR entering into the "strike insurance" pool. This suit was filed to determine the legality of the LIRR, AAR, and other associated railroads entering into this pool with the understanding that if the "strike insurance" was itself illegal, then the defendants would be liable for the damages incurred by the plaintiffs while their members were in strike. The plaintiffs further charged that the defendants used some funds from the pool to run a campaign through the AAR's public relations department designed to influence public opinion against organized labor. </p><p> The only question under consideration by the court was whether the LIRR's purchase of "strike insurance" through the AAR was illegal. In 1962, the court found that it was not. </p><p> Not included in this collection is the decision of the court, which found in favor of the defendants and dismissed the suit without cost [211 F. Supp. 478 (S.D.N.Y. 1962)]. The decision of the court may be found <extref xlink:href="http://www.ecases.us/case/nysd/c1888002/kennedy-v-long-island-railroad-company">here</extref>.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>Inclusive date range: 1961-1962 </p><p> Bulk date: 1961 </p><p> This collection consists of two copies of a brief filed on behalf of the BRT, et al., plaintiffs, by W. P. Kennedy against the LIRR the AAR and associated corporate entities, as well as the jointly prepared record of proceedings, which include the exhibits to joint stipulation of facts, contained in three bound volumes. The brief and the bound volumes of the proceeding contain tables of contents and lists of exhibits presented during the proceedings. The plaintiffs were seeking monetary recompense for damages suffered during a 26 day strike in the summer of 1960 as well as questioning the legality of the LIRR entering, under the auspices of the AAR, into a "strike insurance" monetary pool with other rail carriers in order to strengthen their position in collective bargaining with their employees' unions. Plaintiffs charged that this action was in violation of the Railway Labor Act, the Interstate Commerce Act, and the Sherman Act. </p><p> Included in the plaintiffs' exhibits are reproductions of advertisements the AAR ran in daily newspapers, condemning the practice of "featherbedding" (i.e. retaining jobs that are identified as obsolete, generally as the result of a union contract). These ads compare the cost of featherbedding to the railroads with major American disasters, such as the San Francisco earthquake of 1906 and the Chicago fire of 1871, in an attempt, the plaintiffs argue, to turn public opinion against the unions. Also included in the exhibits are excerpts from the BRT's weekly newsletter and the newspaper, Labor.</p>  </scopecontent>
