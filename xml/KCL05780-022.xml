<p>The International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union was once one of the largest labor unions in the United States founded in 1900 by local union delegates representing about 2,000 members in cities in the northeastern United States. It was one of the first U.S. Unions to have a membership consisting of mostly females, and it played a key role in the labor history of the 1920s and 1930s. The union is generally referred to as the "ILGWU" or the "ILG". The ILGWU grew in geographical scope, membership size, and political influence to become one of the most powerful forces in American organized labor by mid-century. Representing workers in the women's garment industry, the ILGWU worked to improve working and living conditions of its members through collective bargaining agreements, training programs, health care facilities, cooperative housing, educational opportunities, and other efforts. The ILGWU merged with the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union in 1995 to form the Union of Needle trades, Industrial and Textile Employees (UNITE). UNITE merged with the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union (HERE) in 2004 to create a new union known as UNITE HERE. The two unions that formed UNITE in 1995 represented only 250,000 workers between them, down from the ILGWU's peak membership of 450,000 in 1969.</p>  </bioghist>

<p>The White Goods Workers' Union Local 62, also known as the Underwear and White Goods Workers Union, was chartered in 1909, but was not fully organized until 1913. Rose Schneiderman and the Women's Trade Union League assisted with the early organizing efforts of the White Goods Workers. These workers consisted mainly of young immigrant girls. Early leaders of the local included Samuel Shore. On March 1913, 15,000 workers went on strike against the sweatshop conditions. A six week strike ensued in which many of the girls on the picket lines were attacked and arrested. Gains won included a 54 hour week, no Sunday, sanitary conditions and an 18 cent an hour minimum wage. This strike made the local. </p><p> The local and its workers were originally called white goods workers as they manufactured camisoles, chemises, cambric drawers with lace ruffles and drawstrings, and corset covers. Through the years, styles changed and production shifted to panties and slips. In the 1960s, the local became the Undergarment and Negligee Workers' Union Local 62.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Local 62 correspondence consists primarily of letters of Samuel Shore and Louis Stulberg, the managers of the Local during much of the period. These items primarily document the activities and concerns of the Local's leadership from the depression years through the 1960s. The bulk of the material deals with Local administrative matters, benefits, garment manufacturers, other ILGWU departments and locals, political activity (at both the national and local level), relations with other unions, union organizing, wages, and working conditions in the shops. It is mostly restricted to New York City. In addition, there is some personal correspondence of both Shore and Stulberg. </p><p> The first series contains the correspondence of Samuel Shore, manager of Local 62. Topics discussed include parade and demonstration fliers, calls for local elections and polling place locations, final decisions of cases that went to arbitration with the Impartial Chairman, and correspondence with various ILGWU Departments (Education, Health and Welfare), presidents office (David Dubinsky), and Joint Boards and District Councils and Locals. Mixed in are meeting minutes for committees. There are also records documenting the social causes the local was involved with, particularly the children "adopted" by the local in Europe in which they supported and sent money as well as exchanging letters with the children. Information on individual shops can be found in the reports from the Business Agents in which they report on cases, disputes, and conditions. Reports are identified by Business Agent. Historical information can be found in the articles and speeches of Shore. There are photographs of the Local 62 outing to Unity House. </p><p> The second series contains the correspondence of Louis Stulberg, who became manager of Local 62 in 1947. Though, much of his correspondence and work as manager can be found in the first series though. Correspondence occurs with organizations and associations, departments (Education, Auditing, Health and Welfare, Legal, Research, Management Engineering, Union Label ), and includes administrative information (dues, finances, elections). There is much correspondence with firms, and the files are identified by shop name, these often include agreements, arbitration cases. Some of the material contained in the files are from when Stulberg was no longer with the local. </p><p> The third series consists of files from Gerel Rubien, who was the Education Director. Of particular importance is the collection of "Our Union" newsletters and scrapbooks that contain clippings on the garment industry, and more particularly the lingerie and negligee industry and white goods, some from as early as the 1913 strike, as well as the 1933 strike, early agreements, a photograph from 1921, and a collection of speeches. </p><p> Individual correspondents represented in the collection include: David Dubinsky; Jacob Javits; Elias Lieberman; Eleanor Roosevelt; Franklin D. Roosevelt; Rose Schneiderman; Matthew Schoenwald; and Norman Thomas. Organizations include: the AFL-CIO; the American Labor Party; Histadrut; the Jewish Daily Forward; the Jewish Labor Committee; the Liberal Party of New York; the Negro Labor Committee; the National Recovery Administration; the Rand School of Social Research; and the Socialist Party.</p>  </scopecontent>
