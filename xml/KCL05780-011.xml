<p>Founded in 1900 by local union delegates representing about 2,000 members in cities in the northeastern United States, the ILGWU grew in geographical scope, membership size, political influence to become one of the most powerful forces in American organized labor by mid-century. Representing workers in the women's garment industry, the ILGWU worked to improve working and living conditions of its members through collective bargaining agreements, training programs, health care facilities, cooperative housing, educational opportunities, and other efforts. In 1995, the ILGWU merged with the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union (ACTWU) to form the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees (UNITE).</p>  </bioghist>

<p>Isidore Nagler (1895-1959) came to the United States from Austria-Hungary in 1909 and joined Local 10 of the ILGWU in 1911. He held various positions within the ILGWU, including business agent of Local 10, manager of the New York Cloak Joint Board, International vice president, and manager of the New York Joint Board of the Cloak, Shirt, Skirt and Reefer Makers' Union. He was also involved in the work of the New York State Federation of Labor, American Federation of Labor, American Labor Party, Liberal Party, and the Jewish Labor Committee. Nagler served as manager of Local 10 from 1939- 1952. </p><p> Moe Falikman (1893-1971) came to the United State from Austria-Hungary in 1913 and joined Local 10 of the ILGWU in 1916. Within the ILGWU, he served as comptroller, assistant manager, and eventually, manager of Local 10. He also served as chairman of the American Trade Union Council for Histadrut. Falikman served as manager of Local 10 from 1952-1968.</p>  </bioghist>

<p>The Cutters of Local 10 can be traced back to the Gotham Knife Cutters of 1884 and the United Cloak Cutters in 1886 by the Knights of Labor. These were the predecessors of Local 15 and 6 which were chartered by the ILGWU in 1902 and merged to become Local 10 in 1906. Local 10 played a lead role in the 1910 cloakmakers' strike. Local 10 of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU)was also known as the Amalgamated Ladies' Garment Cutters' Union, and based in New York City. Isidore Nagler was Manager of the Amalgamated Ladies' Garment Cutters' Union, Local 10 of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union from 1939 to 1952. Moe Falikman succeeded him, serving as manager from 1953 to 1968.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The collection is arranged alphabetically by subject and composed predominantly of correspondence. Amalgamated Cutters' Union Local 10 was a member of the Joint Board of Cloak, Suit, Skirt and Reefer Makers' Union, as well as the Joint Board of the Dress and Waistmakers' Union. Local 10 held a unique position in that its members were split between both Joint Boards. Cutters of cloaks belonged to the Cloak Joint Board and cutters of dresses belonged to the Dress Joint Board. Local 10's dual position in the Joint Boards is reflected in the records. Historical information about Local 10 and cutters can be found with the materials documenting the local's 65th anniversary in 1976. </p><p> Administrative records include death benefits and disability plans and claims, group contract for the Health and Welfare Fund, names and addresses for members of the executive board as well as business agents, and information on shops that were non-union or "cut-up" shops and employees who became union members. </p><p> There is much material of a political nature including promotional material for political campaigns and campaign donations, both for local elections and the 1968 Humphrey presidential campaign. The ILGWU was a supporter of the Liberal Party, and many members of Local 10 were Liberal Party voters illustrated through correspondence about upcoming elections, candidates and fundraising events. There is substantial information on the election of officers for Local 10, including candidates, slates, literature and pamphlets. Of particular importance is the information regarding the installation of officers, as well as correspondence regarding the ILGWU practice (according to Article 5 Section 28 of the ILGWU constitution) that required newly elected and installed officers to sign undated resignation forms to be deposited with the union. The collection contains some of the resignation forms. </p><p> There are cases that came before the executive board of Local 10. Cases appear in forms and are identified by individual and their firm, branch and decision. Additionally, there are cases and decisions that were brought before the Impartial Chairman. Some of the personal correspondence involves grievance charges filed and cases against the local. Of particular importance is the information on the Ernest Holmes case, as the collection contains correspondence with the lawyers of the local that handled the case, specifically Emil Schlesinger. Ernest Holmes was a general laborer in a corset factory who filed a complaint with the New York State Commission for Human Rights on April 4, 1961 against Local 10. Holmes alleged discrimination in his employment and request for union membership. One of his claims was that he was denied membership to Local 10. After a year-long investigation, in June 1962, the commission revealed that the evidence offered probable cause in the complaint against the union. The report required that the ILGWU, specifically Local 10, to arrange for employment for Holmes, and assured membership in Local 10 contingent upon satisfactory training and progression of skills. Shortly after filing the initial complaint, Holmes had been dismissed from his job for poor performance. After the ruling and over the course of the next two years, Local 10 worked with Holmes to find suitable employment. Often, his lack of skills in the cutting trade prevented him from keeping some of the jobs. It took Holmes until December 1964 before his membership application was finally granted. </p><p> ILGWU General Office folders refer to correspondence with other locals and the International, departments, memos, plant surveys, and the industry. General correspondence to other locals is arranged by local number. Also in the records are member applications for those who registered to participate in the March on Washington. There is correspondence with the Office and Professional Employees International Union Local 153 covered the full time office employees of the union. </p><p> Miscellaneous refers to general correspondence with manufacturers and firms, events, meetings or banquets, with other unions, and members. The Manufacturer Associations represented in the collection include: Affiliated Dress Manufacturers, American Cloak and Suit Manufacturers' Association, Associated Corset and Brassiere Manufacturers, Greater Blouse, Skirt and Neckwear Contractors Association, Children's and Juvenile manufacturers (Infants and Children's Coat Association), Industrial Council of Cloak, Suit and Skirt Manufacturers, Merchants Ladies Garment Association, National Skirt and Sportswear Association, New York Coat and Suit Association, and Popular Priced Dress Manufacturers Group. </p><p> Finally there are the files of Moe Falikman. Falikman was the manager of Local 10 from 1952-1968, and there is correspondence, but also biographical information and photographs of Falikman.</p>  </scopecontent>
