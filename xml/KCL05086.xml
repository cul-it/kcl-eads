<p>The Board consisted of David L. Cole, Chairman, L.W. Horning and George Harrison. </p><p> History: </p><p> This is a case which was referred to the U.S. National Mediation Board under an ad hoc arbitration agreement of March 28, 1956. The Board consisted of David L. Cole, Chairman, L.W. Horning and George Harrison. The issue was: "Does the New York Central Railroad Company have, the right to establish a five day, staggered work week, including Sunday as a regularly assigned work day, under the 40 hour work week agreement? The dispute was first presented to the National Railroad Adjustment Board which could not agree upon a decision. A referee, whose decision was to be final and binding, was appointed by the National Mediation Board. As a result the National Railroad Adjustment Board ruled in favor of the union, but the New York Central Railroad would not agree to abide by this decision. The National Mediation Board then appointed the above Board which began hearings on May 3, 1956. The union's position was that the dispute had already been resolved since the award of the Adjustment Board was binding on both parties, and that the carrier's operations did not require a six or seven day work week, therefore, Sunday could not be included as a regular work day. The carrier held that this was an appeal from the decision of the refree; that the '49 agreement did permit rescheduling where it was necessary. </p><p> Cases D-22-V and D-31-V. </p><p> HISTORICAL BACKGROUND ; </p><p> The parties to this dispute, all located in the Salt Lake City, Utah area signed a contract, effective July 1, 1950 to continue until July 1, 1952 vith a wage reopening provision on July 1, 1951. The 1950 contract provided for a general wage increase of 5 per hour and certain health and pension benefits. In response to the union's request, the companies voluntarily increased wages 10 per hour November 1, 1950. </p><p> "When negotiations vere opened in May of 1951, under the wage reopening clause, the union informed the company it wished to include a program of job evaluation. In the course of the negotiations that followed, the company urged that the "Cooperative Wage Study Manual" should be changed to adapt it to the non-ferrous mining industry. Continued discussions failed to bring an agreement and on March 1, 1952 the parties agreed to submit the dispute to the Wage Stabilization Board for a final and binding decision. </p><p> The Board appointed a tri-partite panel to conduct hearings and to make recommendations to the Board for fair and equitable terms of settlement. The panel consisted of the following members. G. Allan Dash, Jr., Chairman and Public Member, Curtis C. Aller, Public Member, Paul H. Hunt and Francis Ryley, Industry Members, Bernard Greenberg and Albert G. Gray, Labor Members </p><p> The panel held hearings in Salt Lake City in March and its report was issued May 29, 1952. The majority report was submitted by the public and labor members, with the industry members submitting a dissenting report. </p><p> The Board issued its decision on June 20, approving </p><p> an eight-cent general wage adjustment for the 1,000 employees of the three companies, but cut down certain another panel recommendations. The Board's report was issued by the Public Members with the Labor Members dissenting.</p>  </bioghist>
