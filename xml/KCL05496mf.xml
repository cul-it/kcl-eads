    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>This unpublished monograph was prepared by George Novak in 1957-1958 for the Labor Project of the Fund for the Republic, directed by Paul Jacobs. The Fund for the Republic was a non-profit education corporation created by the Ford Foundation in 1952 to counter pressures on civil liberties and basic freedoms from the political right. The Fund wanted to "support activities directed toward the elimination of restrictions on freedom of thought, inquiry and expression in the United States, and the development of policies and procedures best adapted to protect these rights."* </p><p> The manuscript was written by George Novack, who had served the Consolidation Committee of Enginemen [CCE] as public relations advisor. The CCE was a powerful postwar nationwide caucus to affect the fusion of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers [BLE] and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen [BLF&amp;E]. It functioned within the framework of the two unions to achieve amalgamation through constitutional procedures. Beginning in April 1946 under the leadership of Russell R. Walker, the CCE attempted to mobilize the rank and file of the two labor unions in support of unification. The merger plan was defeated in May, 1949. </p><p> Mr. Novak's manuscript describes the development of the CCE, its approach to the issue of unification, and its strategies for organizing in support of a merger. The CCE did succeed in having its program adopted by the conventions of both the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Engineers. </p><p> *Click <extref xlink:href="https://findingaids.princeton.edu/collections/MC059#description">here</extref> for additional information on the Fund for the Republic.</p>  </bioghist>
