    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>The Order of Railway Conductors and Brakemen [ORC] was founded in 1868 as an order of railroad conductors and later expanded to include brakemen. </p><p> The Order of Railway Conductors and Brakemen was founded in 1868 in Amboy, Illinois as the Conductors Union. Initially, it was a fraternal benefit society, but by 1890 it had adopted a policy of engaging in labor negotiations on behalf of its members as well as permitting its members to strike. The name was changed to Order of Railway Conductors of America in 1878. In 1942, the Order of Sleeping Car Conductors merged with ORC. The union's name was changed in 1954 to the Order of Railway Conductors and Brakemen to reflect its changing membership. The ORC International Headquarters, Grand Division, was located in Cedar Rapids, Iowa with subordinate divisions in the United States, Canada, and the Panama Canal Zone. In 1969, the Order merged with the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen, Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, and Switchmen's Union of North America to form the United Transportation Union. </p><p> Local Division 642 was one of the subordinate divisions of the ORC. It was located in West Springfield, Massachusetts; its members were employees of the Boston and Albany Railroad. These employees were split into two divisions, the Boston Division and the Albany Division, each division working the 100-mile stretch from Springfield to either terminal point.</p>  </bioghist>
