    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>The Transport Workers Union of America [TWU] was founded by New York City subway workers in 1934, and then expanded to represent other transit employees across the United States. Their largest Local is Local 100, whose membership consists of New York City's mass transit workers. TWU also represents flight attendants, grounds crew, and maintenance workers for a number of airlines as well as employees of Amtrak, ConRail, and a few short line railroads. </p><p> The TWU was one of the first unions to join the Congress of Industrial Relations [CIO], and was known for its left-leaning politics. One of TWU's founders and its first president, Mike Quill, was a close ally of the Communist Party USA before renouncing all ties in 1948. The TWU was also unique among railroad and transit unions in that it fostered close ties with the African-American community and the NAACP, included quotas for the hiring of African-Americans in its collective bargaining agreements, and supported a strong civil rights platform which advocated for a national platform to combat racism as well as combating the racism found among its own members. </p><p> TWU started representing railway employees in 1954 when the United Railroad Workers of America [URRWA] on the Pennsylvania Railroad [PRR] voted to join the TWU. The URRWA was itself an outgrowth of the CIO's United Railway Organizing Committee, which was chartered in 1941 to organize non-operating employees on the railways. The Committee organized many different non-operating crafts, including carmen, car inspectors, food service workers, maintenance of way, and maintenance of equipment employees. Like the TWU, the URRWA was committed to strong union ideals, promoting racial equality, fighting discrimination, and serving as a counterpoint to the railroad brotherhoods of the AFL. The URRWA represented around 40,000 employees of the Pennsylvania Railroad; in order to increase their negotiating power, the Committee voted to affiliate with the TWU, thus forming the Railroad Division of the TWU. </p><p> In the TWU's first two decades of existence, the International Executive Board was the highest governing authority in between conventions. The Board consisted of the International officers as well as members at large and met quarterly. In the 1950s, after the growth of the union, a smaller executive body was needed for efficiency's sake. The International Executive Council was established, and it took over most of the duties previously held by the Board, which now met only once a year.</p>  </bioghist>
