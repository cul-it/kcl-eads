<p>The Draper Corporation was once the largest maker of power looms for the textile industry in the United States. It operated in Hopedale, Massachusetts for more than 130 years.</p>  </bioghist>
  <scopecontent id="aspace_6dbd99c41d67ad88e1988434c0dfdb58">
    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>This collection consists mostly of prints from the glass plate negatives in collection 6612 GPN: Draper Corporation Glass Plate Negatives. Collection 6612 GPN consists of two series: Series A, 5 inch by 7 inch glass plate negatives, approximately 1,500; and Series B, 8 inch by 10 inch glass plate negatives, approximately 2,000. </p><p> Many of the photographs in Series A depict company outings, or "Field Days." These events were most likely organized by the Draper Company and may have consisted entirely of Draper Company employees. Founders of the Draper Company, brothers George and Ebenezer Draper were responsible for creating an integrated, planned community with innovative employee housing and recreational spaces, in addition to employment. </p><p> Series B consists largely of machinery built by the Draper Company. Also included are photographs of the company plant, employee housing, recreational facilities, and the surrounding area. </p><p> All negatives in collection 6612 GPN have been printed and included in this collection. Of the roughly 3,500 negatives 513 have been described at the individual level. Those descriptions are available in the container lists for both this collection and collection 6612 GPN. </p><p> In addition to the photographs from 6612 GPN, other photographs of Draper Corporation machinery, buildings, employees, and executives are included in this collection.</p>  </scopecontent>

No windows or shutters have been installed on that side, and there are two ladders leaning against the porch roof. (Notes in the accession folder indicate the boardinghouse was "doubled" which may account for the unfinished aspects of it.) A front porch runs the length of the building.

The Draper Corporation produced the Northrup Loom, named for its inventor, who had emigrated from Keighley, Yorkshire, England in 1881. Northrup invented the first fully automatic loom, its basic feature being the filling-changing battery. Northrup looms were first marketed by Draper in 1894. Nothrup retired to California at the age of 42; as he appears to be in his late fifties or early sixties in this portrait, it is most likely a photograph of another photograph. 20.25 x 25.25 cm.</p></scopecontent></c02><c02 id="aspace_1a1cc376f25be725051f42982977c1c2" level="file"><did><unittitle>Item 2227: Draper Model D Loom, Atlantic Mill</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1919/1919">1919</unitdate><physdesc id="aspace_85e9429d192e0cc291a31869ba8f1514" label="Format:">black and white photograph</physdesc><container id="aspace_02475c9eba142b1f370052e43946c320" label="unspecified" type="box">11</container><container id="aspace_01c72ea1d32cd09fd110fea5f483cec5" parent="aspace_02475c9eba142b1f370052e43946c320" type="folder">6</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_29bbfcb084ed1925c9d649790f2b2a35"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Printed in 1974 from glass plate negative no.B2227.

A wrap-around porch and set of steps join the front entry with a walkway to the sidewalk and street. Shrubs and climbing vines surround the porch and house. Ballou (1803-1890) was a prominent proponent of pacifism, socialism and abolitionism, and the founder (in 1842) of the Hopedale Community, a utopian community blending a factory town with a religious-based commune. George and Ebenezer Draper withdrew their 75% of the community stock in 1856 to establish the Hopedale Manufacturing Company. Ballou continued on as Universalist pastor until retirement in 1880. The house was moved from its original location in 1900 to Dutcher Street and the porch added to the building. See Box 2, Folder 3, Item 188 and Item 199 for views of the house in its original location at Peace and Hopedale streets.

It is unclear which building is which, although the one-story building on the right with the striped awnings may be the office. There is a one-story wooden clapboard building with a tower in the center left; in the background are several three- and four-story brick buildings, all part of the Draper Company complex. The sign on the pole in front of the wooden clapboard building reads: "Private Property. Do No Drive In. Very Dangerous." The wooden clapboard building is at a junction of Hopedale and another street, both unpaved. A set of trolley tracks runs along Hopedale Street. A water tower is on the top of the building at the right in the background. The Draper Company manufactured textile machinery, primarily looms. See Item 136, in this folder, for a view of the buildings on the street to the left of what is shown in this image, and Box 12, Folder 4, Item 165 for a view of the east side of Hopedale Street taken from behind the pole with the sign.

The church is located at 65 Hopedale Street; the unpaved street can be seen in the foreground. The parish was formed October 2, 1867. The church building was erected through the generosity of Eben S. Draper and George Albert Draper in memory of their father and mother. Dedication services for the church edifice were held on September 15, 1898. The architectural style is English Gothic.

May 7, 1903. Image depicts a view of the west side of Hopedale Street in Hopedale, Massachusetts, showing two residential houses on the left, behind which are Draper Company buildings. Both houses are two-story wooden clapboard buildings with shutters at all the windows; the house nearer the center has an open front porch. Behind the two houses on the right is a three-story building with a tall smokestack, part of the Draper Company complex. The streets are unpaved, but Hopedale Street is lined with trees. Trolley tracks run along Hopedale Street. The unknown cross street has a sidewalk. The Draper Company manufactured textile machinery, primarily looms. See Box 12, Folder 4, Item 135 for a view of the buildings on the street to the right of what is shown in this image.
