    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>This collection consists mostly of prints from the glass plate negatives in collection 6612 GPN: Draper Corporation Glass Plate Negatives. Collection 6612 GPN consists of two series: Series A, 5 inch by 7 inch glass plate negatives, approximately 1,500; and Series B, 8 inch by 10 inch glass plate negatives, approximately 2,000. </p><p> Many of the photographs in Series A depict company outings, or "Field Days." These events were most likely organized by the Draper Company and may have consisted entirely of Draper Company employees. Founders of the Draper Company, brothers George and Ebenezer Draper were responsible for creating an integrated, planned community with innovative employee housing and recreational spaces, in addition to employment. </p><p> Series B consists largely of machinery built by the Draper Company. Also included are photographs of the company plant, employee housing, recreational facilities, and the surrounding area. </p><p> All negatives in collection 6612 GPN have been printed and included in this collection. Of the roughly 3,500 negatives 513 have been described at the individual level. Those descriptions are available in the container lists for both this collection and collection 6612 GPN. </p><p> In addition to the photographs from 6612 GPN, other photographs of Draper Corporation machinery, buildings, employees, and executives are included in this collection.</p>  </scopecontent>

No windows or shutters have been installed on that side, and there are two ladders leaning against the porch roof.

The Draper Corporation produced the Northrup Loom, named for its inventor, who had emigrated from Keighley, Yorkshire, England in 1881. Northrup invented the first fully automatic loom, its basic feature being the filling-changing battery. Northrup looms were first marketed by Draper in 1894. Nothrup retired to California at the age of 42; as he appears to be in his late fifties or early sixties in this portrait, it is most likely a photograph of another photograph. 20.25 x 25.25 cm.</p></scopecontent></c02><c02 id="aspace_1a1cc376f25be725051f42982977c1c2" level="file"><did><unittitle>Item 2227: Draper Model D Loom, Atlantic Mill</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1919/1919">1919</unitdate><physdesc id="aspace_85e9429d192e0cc291a31869ba8f1514" label="Format:">black and white photograph</physdesc><container id="aspace_fae6e650d7bbaf4633749cae97d0ed00" label="unspecified" type="box">11</container><container id="aspace_0cc3c664d8fc3503a288ea3792a1aac5" parent="aspace_fae6e650d7bbaf4633749cae97d0ed00" type="folder">6</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_29bbfcb084ed1925c9d649790f2b2a35"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Printed in 1974 from glass plate negative no.B2227.

The feeler projects into the shuttle from the side and feels the yarn on the bobbin. When the bobbin is approaching emptiness, the feeler actuates the transfer motion and replaces the bobbin. A cop is a yarn package. The Draper Corporation manufactured textile machinery, primarily looms. 25.25 x 20.25 cm.</p></scopecontent></c02><c02 id="aspace_29d4b294c2d3a8c32035d2af172b5a9b" level="file"><did><unittitle>Item 2259: Field Day, general view</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1919/1919">1919</unitdate><physdesc id="aspace_c094d472f80bea600fcb6e7b085fa056" label="Format:">black and white photograph</physdesc><container id="aspace_5959c235be767d5f2fa32a1c76bf5045" label="unspecified" type="box">12</container><container id="aspace_15e27b286b6f0277f9c62db3004e2aa9" parent="aspace_5959c235be767d5f2fa32a1c76bf5045" type="folder">1</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_5e3872563de4dc1c8ca25172ac75c9de"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Printed in 1974 from glass plate negative no.B2259.

A wrap-around porch and set of steps join the front entry with a walkway to the sidewalk and street. Shrubs and climbing vines surround the porch and house. Ballou (1803-1890) was a prominent proponent of pacifism, socialism and abolitionism, and the founder (in 1842) of the Hopedale Community, a utopian community blending a factory town with a religious-based commune. George and Ebenezer Draper withdrew their 75% of the community stock in 1856 to establish the Hopedale Manufacturing Company. Ballou continued on as Universalist pastor until retirement in 1880. The house was moved from its original location in 1900 to Dutcher Street and the porch added to the building. See Box 2, Folder 3, Item 188 and Item 199 for views of the house in its original location at Peace and Hopedale streets.

February 11, 1911. Image depicts an unidentified male operative demonstrating how mill operatives would suck the thread through the eye of a shuttle. The man holds the shuttle to his mouth; he would use his right hand to draw the thread out. Mill operatives would draw the thread through their mouths to help smooth it and make it easier to draw through the eye of the shuttle. However, sucking on cotton thread could eventually cause lung problems and did so in many mill operatives. The unidentified man wears work clothes: dark shirt and pants with a light tie. He also wears wire-rimmed glasses. The demonstration takes place in an unidentified mill; the battery of a loom can be seen on the left. He is presumably a Draper Company employee. See Item 862 and Item 863, in this folder, for images of another employee demonstrating this, and Box 15, Folder 2, Item 870 through Item 874 for images demonstrating this procedure using a skeleton.

Mill operatives would draw the thread through their mouths to help smooth it and make it easier to draw through the eye of the shuttle. However, sucking on cotton thread could eventually cause lung problems and did so in many mill operatives. The unidentified man wears a three-piece suit and wire-rimmed glasses. Whether he is a Draper Company executive or someone else is unknown. See also Item 871 and Item 872, in this folder, for other views of this man; Item 870 and Item 874, in this folder, for a younger man demonstrating the same thing; and Box 15, Folder 1, Item 862 and Item 863 to see a male mill operative demonstrate this operation on a mill floor. As the Draper Company manufactured textile machinery, primarily looms, and did not manufacture cloth, it is unclear what relation this photograph has to Draper unless it was to demonstrate something with their looms. 25.25 x 20.25 cm.</p></scopecontent></c02><c02 id="aspace_3e3910764ec7cbfa86fe030fdd09660b" level="file"><did><unittitle>Item 874: Sucking thread through the shuttle eye, Draper Company</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1911/1911">1911</unitdate><physdesc id="aspace_56c293bf17896f850039a976f81c7e6e" label="Format:">black and white photograph</physdesc><container id="aspace_c8e2f3730fd03e85146b6f92f7955968" label="unspecified" type="box">15</container><container id="aspace_47a6be25ca36344040658c83ad36ab04" parent="aspace_c8e2f3730fd03e85146b6f92f7955968" type="folder">2</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_c3ec8faa9d664e9c94ef03faa2786373"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Printed in 1974 from glass plate negative no.B874.
