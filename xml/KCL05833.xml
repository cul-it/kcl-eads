    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>James A. Paddock spent his entire life working in the railroad industry. After completing his education at the University of San Francisco in 1937, he entered train service as a brakeman and switchman for the Bingham and Garfield Railway, part of the Kennecott Utah Copper rail line in Salt Lake County, Utah. He was promoted to conductor in 1941. Starting in 1938, Mr. Paddock became active with the Order of Railway Conductors [ORC] as a General Committee Member. In 1948, he accepted full-time employment as Assistant to the President of the International Union, headquartered in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. In 1954, he was elected to the office of Senior Vice-President, and in 1958 to the Office of President. During his tenure as president of ORC, he served on the Presidential Railroad Commission from 1959-1961. In 1961, Mr. Paddock retired from the ORC presidency in order to seek treatment for his alcoholism. </p><p> In 1963, Mr. Paddock returned to work in the railroad industry, joining the Association of Western Railways as a Special Representative to the Law Department, working on matters where labor and management had a mutual interest, such as safety on grade crossings. He retired from active railroad employment in 1970 because of a health issue. </p><p> In 1971, Mr. Paddock began training as a counselor specializing in alcohol and drug addiction. With his new training, Mr. Paddock began to work as an independent consultant in the area of industrial programs and other aspects involving alcohol and drug related research and development in the work place. In this capacity, he assisted the Milwaukee Road, the Illinois Central, and the Elgin, Joliet and Eastern Railway in setting up Employee Assistance Programs [EAP] and other services designed to improve safety and operations. In 1973, he began consulting for the Federal Railroad Administration in this capacity. He took part in two major studies of alcoholism and drug abuse in the railroad industry in 1976 and 1979, conducting research and writing the reports. The 1979 report became known as the REAP report. He continued his work in this area with officers of the United Transportation Union [UTU], specifically Daniel Collins, in the 1980s. Using the EAP of the Union Pacific as their model, the UTU championed a labor- management supported program called Operation Red Block designed to help railroad operating employees with substance abuse problems and to help their co-workers know how to appropriately respond and help their fellows. A key component of these programs are the so-called "Rule G By-Pass Agreements." Rule G is the prohibition against operating while intoxicated. The By-Pass Agreements allow for voluntary self-reporting or co-worker reporting on a one time basis so that an employee might avoid serious disciplinary measures for the first offense and be put into a counseling program to address their addiction. </p><p> Mr. Paddock, in a speech he gave in 1983, called this work his avocation.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>Inclusive date range: 1954-1988 </p><p> Bulk dates: 1975-1988 </p><p> This collection consists of the papers of James A. Paddock. The majority of the papers document his work in the 1970s and 1980s combatting drug and alcohol abuse in the railroad industry. This collection also contains some records of the Order of Railway Conductors and Brakemen [ORC] and the report of the Presidential Commission on Railroads. </p><p> Of note in this collection are the records documenting the ways in which the railroad industry, both labor and management, attempted to address problems of substance abuse among its employees, in particular among its operating employees. The programs include various EAPs, including Operation: Red Block. Records documenting industry research, substance abuse research, employee training, and counselor training are found in this collection. Also found are the records of various Senate and House bills, hearings, and committees which attempt to address substance abuse issues through federal statutes and operating guidelines. The lawsuits filed by the Railway Labor Executives' Association [RLEA] in opposition to some of these proposed guidelines, such as random drug testing, on constitutional grounds. The clippings files give a broad overview of the national mood at the time, and demonstrate how some of these programs intersected with President Reagan's War on Drugs, and the disastrous consequences it had. </p><p> Of note is the correspondence sent to Daniel Collins, Assistant General Secretary and Treasurer and Director of Employee Assistance Programs for the UTU. Some of these letters humanize the individual struggles faced by railroad employees during this period. One employee wrote to Mr. Collins to discuss how the use of sniffer dogs sparked PTSD flashbacks to his time as a Prisoner of War in Germany during World War II. The speech by lawyer and recovering alcoholic J. Paul Molloy gave to the Senate in 1984 during subcommittee hearings on substance abuse in the workplace also highlights how a humane approach to these issues might be more successful than harsher disciplinary actions. </p><p> Finally, this collection contains a Betamax VHS cassette from the Union Pacific Railroad used as a training tool for Operation: Red Block and its EAP.</p>  </scopecontent>
