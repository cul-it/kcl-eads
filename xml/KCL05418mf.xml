    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>The Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), proposed by John L. Lewis in 1928, was a federation of unions that organized workers in industrial unions in the United States and Canada from 1935 to 1955. The Committee for Industrial Organization was formed by the presidents of eight international unions in 1935. The presidents of these unions were dissatisfied with the American Federation of Labor's unwillingness to commit itself to a program of organizing industrial unions. In 1936, the A.F. of L. suspended the ten unions which proceeded to organize an independent federation, the Congress of Industrial Organizations. The CIO subsequently became the A.F. of L.'s chief rival for the leadership of American unions. The groups were reunited in 1955 as the AFL-CIO.</p>  </bioghist>

Executive Council granting jurisdictional rights over radio workers to the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (1936); the state of organizing efforts in steel, auto, and rubber industries; the 1936 strike against Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company in Akron, Ohio by the United Rubber Workers of America; invitations to bakery workers, brewery workers, hotel and restaurant workers, flat glass workers, and brick and clay workers to join the CIO. </p><p> Other subjects include the settlement of the San Francisco shipyard strike (1936); A.F. of L. Executive Council demands that the CIO disband (1936); United Rubber Workers organizing in Gadsden, Ala.; anti-union activities in the Alabama industries of textiles, steel, iron, mining and coal; United Rubber Workers organizing in Detroit; referral to the International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers of a request for assistance in organizing in the cement industry; fear of craft segregation in the cement industry; strife between the St. Louis Building Trades Council and the Quarry Workers International Union of North America; and request for aid by the Brotherhood of Brewery Workers in their struggle against the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Stablemen and Helpers of America (1936). </p><p> Includes, as well, correspondence from Charles P. Howard to William Green (1935) relating to the "paramount" importance of organizing unorganized workers; correspondence regarding the rights of minorities within the A.F. of L.; and discussions about the jurisdictional rights of extant unions and the question of dual unionism. Other correspondence includes that of Howard and John L. Lewis (1936) regarding suspension of CIO unions from the A.F. of L.; and of William J. Carney, regional director, CIO, to Sidney Hillman (1939) on factionalism within the United Automobile Workers and attempts by the Homer Martin faction to split the CIO. </p><p> Additionally, includes numerous statements and replies to the A.F. of L.

Executive Council that the CIO was fostering dual unionism; the necessity of organizing steelworkers along industrial lines; a request from the CIO to the A.F. of L. Executive Council to grant the Radio and Allied Trades National Labor Council a charter on an industrial basis (1936); and the necessity to hold an auto workers' convention (1936). </p><p> Finally, includes a manuscript entitled "John L. Lewis and the C.I.O., July 11, 1941" (no author) dealing with the following issues: differences between Sidney Hillman, Jacob Potofsky and the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America (ACWA) and John L. Lewis regarding Franklin D. Roosevelt, the Office of Production Management (OPM), the reality of a national emergency, and Lewis's support of Wendell Willkie in the 1940 presidential election; Lewis's animosity toward Franklin Roosevelt; Lewis's opinions about "Hitlerism" and the Tories in Britain; the May anti-strike bill; communists in the CIO; support by Potofsky and the ACWA for an anti-communist resolution at the 1940 CIO convention; Philip Murray on communists in the CIO; and allegations against Sidney Hillman, in his official capacity as a member of the OPM and the A.F. of L. Building Trades Department, relating to his activities regarding government contracts. </p><p> A negative copy is available upon request.</p>  </scopecontent>
