    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>The American Association for Labor Legislation was formed to promote uniformity of labor legislation and to encourage the study of labor conditions with a view toward promoting desirable legislation. </p><p> The Association was founded as a branch of the International Association for Labor Legislation. Preliminary discussions about forming the group occurred during 1905 and culminated in the first meeting of the Association held on February 15, 1906, in New York City. </p><p> During the Association's first few years, three basic objectives were established: to serve as the American branch of the International Association for Labor Legislation; to promote uniformity of labor legislation in the United States; and to encourage the study of labor conditions with a view toward promoting desirable labor legislation. </p><p> John Bertram Andrews was appointed executive secretary in 1909. His wife, Irene Osgood Andrews, eventually became associate secretary. John Andrews, as lobbyist, lecturer, author and editor of the publication THE AMERICAN LABOR LEGISLATION REVIEW, became the motivating force of the Association. Broadly speaking, the American Association for Labor Legislation set the following goals: the alleviation of adverse working conditions; the creation of laws to protect safety and health on the job; and the provision of compensation in times of unemployment and benefits for workers no longer able to participate in the labor force. To facilitate the implementation of the Association's interests, study groups were established to investigate labor conditions. Active lobbying was undertaken in support of protective labor legislation in state and federal legislatures, and critiques were published concerning pending bills. The lifetime of the Association roughly corresponded to Andrew's lifetime; its activities ceased after his death in 1943.</p>  </bioghist>

Much of the initiative for its inauguration was taken by Adna F. Weber and Henry W. Farnam, whose interest in the International Association for Labor Legislation (IALL) inspired the establishment of its American counterpart. A circular and an invitation to attend the general meeting to organize the American section of the IALL on Feb. 15, 1906, drew favorable response from several persons who would later be influential in the Association, notably Samuel Gompers and Miles Mehander Dawson. The formal founding of the AALL dates from that 1906 meeting, and subsequent correspondence deals with the leadership and personnel problems of the infant association, as well as with the relationship of the new organization to the IALL. Richard T. Ely, first president of the AALL, wrote to Weber (2/26/07) commenting that the AALL needed a paid representative to give his full time to the work. The perennial problem of fund raising became a theme early in the organization's correspondence. During 1908, the course that the AALL was to follow for the next few years was developed. John R. Commons, then secretary, wrote to Dr. Henry B. Favill of the American Medical Association expressing a desire to meet with him and Dr. Alice Hamilton to discuss the investigation of occupational health and disease (1/21/08). This dialogue accelerated the development of a standard nomenclature for occupational disease and a proposal to investigate and recommend standards for industrial hygiene. Newly appointed Assistant Secretary Irene Osgood exchanged letters with Margaret D. Robins. Their correspondence concerned the Association's desire to investigate industrial diseases and poisons, and the plans for establishment of state chapters. Support for the organization was sought and won from socially conscious national leaders, including Louis Brandeis, Edward T. Devine, Samuel Gompers, and Alice Hamilton. The assistance of reform-minded groups such as the National Child Labor Committee was also successfully solicited. Early in 1909, Commons and Osgood suggested to Henry W. Farnam that John Andrews would make an excellent executive secretary. There was some question at this juncture as to whether the official stationery of the Association should carry the union label. Arguments on this issue went on for several years and are symptomatic of the organization's ambivalent attitude toward organized labor. Dr. Alice Hamilton continued her work with the AALL on industrial poisons and her letter to Osgood (2/13/09) suggested that a study of the match industry be undertaken because of its widespread use of poisonous white phosphorous.</p></scopecontent></c01><c01 id="aspace_4f59b27bbc2538df37683bcc17af0986" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence: 1909, Mar 22 - 1910, Mar 18.</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1909/1910" type="inclusive">1909-1910</unitdate><container id="aspace_ad7a7ece59f15f3a01e19816f4643248" label="unspecified" type="reel">2</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_f23c8380b2e6b2b9e35b65f2bc78fa7b"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The investigation into phosphorous poisoning continued and developed into the "Phossy Jaw" study. Interest arose in the Association in workmen's compensation and the Illinois 10-Hour Law, and John Andrews became the paid executive of the organization at about this time. Louis Brandeis wrote to Arthur Kellogg (5/26/09) about the pension bill of the Boston and Maine Railroad. The letter is significant for its early discussion of certain provisions which eventually were adopted into the American old age pension system. Correspondence during this period relates: to changes in legislation in regard to job hazards, insurance, employment office regulations, and child labor. The organization cooperated extensively with Brandeis and Josephine Goldmark in the preparation of material with which to fight defeat of the Illinois 10-Hour Law. Louis Brandeis expressed his gratitude to Andrews (11/30/09) for the information Andrews gathered for Brandeis' work on the 10-Hour case brief. John R. Commons wrote Henry W. Farnam (12/25/09), suggesting that the Association would do better to concern itself with active lobbying for measures it supported rather than with organizing. Since the state branches of the Association were not proving satisfactory. Commons thought that they should be discontinued. Early in 1910 the executive office was transferred to New York City where it remained for the life of the Association. In February John Andrews began to collect information on a contributory workmen's compensation insurance plan; and the Association continued to refine this plan for the next thirty years.</p></scopecontent></c01><c01 id="aspace_c65ad22081f1ef4741b22184127eb8ad" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence: 1910, Mar 19 - July 25.</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1910/1910">1910</unitdate><container id="aspace_caa298b9ff1fb72bcf16d835de1ffd7e" label="unspecified" type="reel">3</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_84e3099c024406c177c26b722590c1b2"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The development of campaigns for workmen's compensation and against the use of poison phosphorous continued.

Joseph Chamberlain outlined a suggested survey of European sickness insurance (1/7/14) to be made prior to the AALL's investigation of the situation in the United States. Many meetings of the Association's sickness insurance committee were held. I. M. Rubinow wrote often in reference to drafting a standard bill (a prototype legislative bill on a specific issue) on sickness insurance. There was some controversy over whether or not it should be compulsory, and P. Tecumseh Shermam resigned because of the disagreement (1/9/14). An interesting letter (9/16/13) to Henry Seager and Henry W. Farnam describes Andrews' visit to the Cripple Creek Mine, the mine owner's blacklist, a meeting with "Mother" Jones, and the growing conservatism of the Western Federation of Miners. Irene Osgood Andrews wrote the report on minimum wage legislation in New York State. In December (12/24/13) Andrews wrote again to Gompers, asking for an apology. Andrews became interested in another problem of working conditions and wrote often to Thomas J. Parkinson of the Columbia University Legislative Drafting Department and others in regard to revision of the compressed air provisions of the New York State labor laws.</p></scopecontent></c01><c01 id="aspace_fb71d0a8a1147275b98d504cbce61236" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence: 1914, Jan 22 - June 18.</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1914/1914">1914</unitdate><container id="aspace_05894a1655b0d2a599363e7bb729cf2d" label="unspecified" type="reel">11</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_9e98618beeb3c47091b79915eef8664c"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The Association sponsored the "Kern Bill" introduced in Congress by its sponsor, Congressman John Kern, providing workmen's compensation for federal employees in the District of Columbia.

Throughout January and February, plans were made for the National Conference on Unemployment that was to be held in New York City (2/27/28). In addition, the growing problem of unemployment sparked many surveys and reports. The meetings of the Sickness Insurance Committee continued. Andrews defended the AALL's impartiality on "unionism" to James Emery (2/26/14) and disclaimed any interest in labor-management disputes beyond the questions of health and safety. Mid-March saw John and Irene Andrews working together on a survey of free employment bureaus, and for the passage of a free employment agency bill in the New York State Legislature. In June, Andrews began to prepare for the European Congresses of the IALL by writing reports on United States labor legislation, unemployment, social insurance and industrial disease.</p></scopecontent></c01><c01 id="aspace_aef42bee3f1c91291bb31fed6b689b45" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence: 1914, June 19 - Oct 31.</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1914/1914">1914</unitdate><container id="aspace_bf610b54d8ffebe56562e1dc020207ea" label="unspecified" type="reel">12</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_a3c002f0e303aab157c3ab2f29f1b5e1"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The commencement of World War I affected the Association drastically, The IALL congresses were cancelled and funds that had been available to further the work of the AALL were diverted to war relief.

Katherine Coman suggested (8/13/14) that the committee stress prevention as well as relief, a change that was soon made. Many requests for help in drafting workmen's compensation laws were received from all over the United States during this period. Andrews was busy on a study of occupational anthrax in the United States. In the fall, a study of the effect of lead poisoning on workers was begun, using the Brooklyn Bridge painters as a test group. Walter Lippmann interviewed Andrews on the unemployment problem in October for a special issue of the New Republic. John R.

John Andrews' letter to James Maurer (7/12/15) is an excellent example of the strategy employed by the Association in exploiting emo-tions to explain the need for their legislation. This letter deals with the death of two "sand hogs" who were buried alive in an accident that "...could not have occurred if our bill for the protection of compressed air workers had been in force in Pennsylvania." On August 9, a series of letters and a questionnaire on relief of unemployment through public work was sent out.

The program on social insurance was to stress workmen's compensation, health insurance and unemployment insurance. Accident and disease reporting, support for the federal bill for a Museum of Safety, and the urging of passage of the standard bill for compressed air workers and a cleanliness bill for lead workers were to dominate the industrial safety and hygiene phase of the Association's work. To meet the abuses of the so-called continuous industries, a one-day-rest-in-seven bill was advocated, as was the three-shift system. Finally, the Association was to urge reorganization of state labor bureaus, especially in Kentucky, Maryland, and New Jersey, as a means of making the administration of existent labor legislation more effective. The health insurance standard bill was introduced in Albany and Boston. John Randolph Haynes approached Andrews (1/29/16) and volunteered a substantial contribution if the AALL would make coal mine safety the first priority of its program. Through May, Royal Meeker, Middleton Beaman, and others worked with the Association in urging passage of the Kern-McGillicuddy Bill (workmen's compensation for District of Columbia). In April, Andrews testified before the United States House of Representatives Committee on Labor in favor of the establishment of a Commission for Investigating Social Insurance. Frederick Hoffman resigned from the Association in a letter to Irving Fisher, in protest against the AALL's insistence upon compulsory health insurance.</p></scopecontent></c01><c01 id="aspace_7dc9c6ca98c27e14796af852e531280f" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence: 1916, Apr 22 - 1917, June 30.</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1916/1917" type="inclusive">1916-1917</unitdate><container id="aspace_a40ba83671d9d72dbc590fb891ce6dd4" label="unspecified" type="reel">17</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_e4edab187bf4522b477957b89a2b9101"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Intensive lobbying for health insurance continued as Andrews con-ducted a campaign to raise funds for its promotion with the slogan, "Health First." The Association supported legislative bills for health insurance in New York and Michigan. On the federal level, the AALL's most important piece of legislation was the Kern-McGillicuddy Bill. In May, John Andrews sent AALL staffer Irene Sylvester to Washington to act as the Association's lobbyist. Her informal letters to the New York office, reporting on the progress of the bill, give examples of how one congressman put pressure on another to insure his vote. In June, when she complained of discouragement, Andrews wrote to her, "Cheer Up! Morbid depression is an occupational disease among those who are obliged to be pleasant to Congressmen." (6/5/17) In late August, Andrews was able to inform the AALL members that the bill had passed the Senate and that "...we can now concentrate even greater effort on our campaign for universal health insurance." Paul H. Douglas advised Andrews that since war seemed inevitable, the Association should adopt a policy of guarding against exploitation of workers in time of war (4/1/17) .. John Andrews initiated a special series of bulletins, Labor Laws in War Time. Communication with the IALL offices in Europe became virtually impossible.</p></scopecontent></c01><c01 id="aspace_8a6fcd12fee369ac334ba014128bb871" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence: 1917, July 1 - 1918, Dec 9.</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1917/1918" type="inclusive">1917-1918</unitdate><container id="aspace_09187c2e492ef71809d64cc2572849a0" label="unspecified" type="reel">18</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_c1d4ca99402043631dd8f491d5616b59"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Under the pressure of the war effort, demands for health insurance were de-emphasized, while problems created by the emergency came to the fore.

In December of 1916, Andrews advised Senator Joseph Robinson (12/6/17) that the legislation providing for federal public employment offices which he was to introduce should be pushed as a war emergency measure. This is referred to as the Robinson-Keating Bill in later letters., Gompers, largely out of touch with the Association, telegraphed an invitation to Andrews to attend the American Federation of Labor Employment Problems Conference. A form letter to members (12/19/17) outlined the program for 1918, which included war emergency measures, Federal Public Employment Ser-vice, health insurance, and labor adjustment. In mid-January 1918, Charles Barnes, Irving Fisher, Royal Meeker, V. Everitt Macy and Edward Keating all wrote to Andrews, urging him to take the lead in the fight for the Robinson- Keating Bill. Irene Osgood Andrews became very much involved in efforts to organize the Maternity Center in New York City. Many state federations of labor wrote for advice on health insurance, and in the fall, the AALL worked for workmen's compensation in Maine, Arkansas and North Dakota.</p></scopecontent></c01><c01 id="aspace_6d31e0db362f1311254b0b9027248d5f" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence: 1918, Dec 10 - 1919, Apr 30.</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1918/1919" type="inclusive">1918-1919</unitdate><container id="aspace_a9d0f74522572d70563cdba86dd73059" label="unspecified" type="reel">19</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_5d01d4bf60438ceb7c307be96ff32865"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>A letter from Andrews to New York State senators (12/18/18) set forth the Association's objectives for 1919, including an amendment of workmen's compensation legislation to exclude profit-making insurance companies, universal workingman's health insurance, and a minimum wage for women. In early January, Henry Sterling sent a copy of the workmen's compensation act which he had prepared for the American Federation of Labor to Andrews for his criticism. Letters were received from IALL staff members Sophy Sanger and Stephen Bauer, trying to re-establish communications. Frances Perkins, Commissioner of the New York State Industrial Commission, wrote to ask for information on maternity insurance, and later wrote to Irene Andrews for John's views on health insurance. Irene Sylvester, now Mrs. Walston Chubb, was sent by the Associa-tion to Albany to lobby for the Donahue-Davenport health insurance bill. In March 1919, a new standard bill for workmen's compensation was issued , based on that of the state of Ohio and on federal legis-lation. Irene Andrews wrote Sophy Sanger (4/2/19) that she expected to be in London in April to tour maternity centers, and that John would be in London later that summer.</p></scopecontent></c01><c01 id="aspace_78e21632f7b06f1b5e0a5ea2bbc19910" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence: 1919, May 1 - Nov 25.</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1919/1919">1919</unitdate><container id="aspace_bd1aa99fd749b1cebbe630fa72c88fbe" label="unspecified" type="reel">20</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_1a65548c8b5a580893e00be40c3839c5"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>John Andrews sailed for Europe in mid-July to further the work of the Association for the educational commission of the United States War Department.

The area of special interest in workmen's compensation during late 1925 and early 1926 was the passage of legislation to protect interstate workers, especially longshoremen and seamen. Anthony Chlopek of the longshoremen and Andrew Furuseth of the seamen were the Association's chief union contacts. Throughout January and February, several criticisms of the AALL's newest federal longshoremen's and interstate workers' compensation bill were received? those from Charles Verrill (1/18/26), Frederick Wilcox (1/20/26), and Frances Perkins (2/4/26) are especially significant.</p></scopecontent></c01><c01 id="aspace_e055656e59b444db0e3dae6ef8e389d2" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence: 1926, Jan 27 - 1926, June 18.</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1926/1926">1926</unitdate><container id="aspace_73a5c5c9c07bd78387a5d3d3113f18d2" label="unspecified" type="reel">33</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_6df06de447f8d810aaab528d79e83682"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Correspondence of this period centers on the AALL's announcement (2/19/26) that its federal compensation bill for longshoremen had been introduced in the House and would be referred to as the Cummins-Graham Bill.

Congressman Graham gave John Andrews his version of the reason why the bill never was called out of committee in the House, although it did pass the Senate. From August through December, Andrews kept up a running correspondence with Charles Verrill and Anthony Chlopek on amendments to the Graham-Cummins bill that might enable it to pass at the next session. In late November Thomas Chadbourne made an unusual pledge to the Association, promising to give $10,000 a year for the next three years if Andrews could raise $15,000. The money was intended especially to wipe the "black spots" off the compensation map. (The AALL Review periodically published a map showing workmen's compensation legislation's spread by state. Those states without any compensation law at all were shown in solid black, hence "black spots.") Andrews replied to this letter (12/2/26). Programs for 1927 included achieving workmen's compensation laws in those five states still without them, workmen's compensation for longshoremen (Graham-Cummins), and mine safety. John Andrews went frequently to Washington to organize support for the Graham-Cummins bill. The legislation was finally passed on March 4, 1927. Throughout March, letters were received regretting the effect of the American Association for Old Age Security (Epstein's new organiza-tion, AAOAS) on the American Association for Labor Legislation. Most officers of the new association were AALL members and many felt that they had been misled by Epstein in regard to John Andrews' support for the AAOAS.</p></scopecontent></c01><c01 id="aspace_cf546c50c82f523433a9eb4b05b93a1f" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence: 1927, Mar 7 - Oct 31.</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1927/1927">1927</unitdate><container id="aspace_a46dfec3a42e4ee186707a5cc7607f89" label="unspecified" type="reel">35</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_54130b48ef34651aa558762d8f31e3ac"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Concerned over the problem of two national organizations dedicated to very similar purposes, Paul H.

He also began an attack on the lack of workmen's compensation legislation in Florida with a series of letters to local politicians and local AALL members. A blow to the Association's mine safety campaign came when J. R. Haynes informed Andrews (8/2/27) that he would have to discontinue his financial support of the AALL in order to concentrate on a public ownership plan in Los Angeles. Andrews sought funding from the United Mine Workers. A letter in the fall from John L.

Before the Fitzgerald Bill was enacted, Margaret Hobbs James had succeeded to the position of AALL lobbyist.

John Andrews queried Felix Frankfurter and others about the possibility of compensation for railroad workers. Frankfurter's reply (10/30/28) did not favor a federal program, but suggested individual state legislation. Andrews was always keenly interested in national politics and supported Al Smith against Herbert Hoover. In November, after Smith's defeat, he wrote Solon De Leon that he was terribly disappointed, "Our vaunted religious liberty is but a bubble that has been pricked." Turning his attention to New York State, he wrote the then Governor-elect, Franklin D. Roosevelt, suggesting that he include occupational disease compensation and regulation of fee-charging private employment agencies in his 1929 message to the legislature. Governor Roosevelt replied that he thought the AALL's proposal of blanket coverage for occupational diseases was reasonable, and that he did not anticipate much objection to the proposals. Andrews wrote to Felix Frankfurter again, this time to inquire whether Frankfurter had written a minimum wage bill that would meet the constitutional objections. Frankfurter replied (12/20/28) that he felt that he and B. V. Cohen had, but that correspondence was too cumbersome a medium for discussion; Mr. Cohen would come to confer with Mr. Andrews. The program for 1929 was planned to include the social cost of accidents, sickness and old age insurance, unemployment, labor law administration and workmen's compensation for the new industrial South. A form letter (1/23/29) urged that members write in support of the vocational rehabilitation bill, the Jones Property Reserve Bill and the Wagner Bill (in earlier years known as the Kenyon-Nolan Bill) for adequate public employment bureaus. Margaret James Hobbs wrote (2/4/29) that she was discouraged in her work for the passage of the vocational rehabilitation bill, and expressed hope that Andrews would come to Washington to organize support for it.</p></scopecontent></c01><c01 id="aspace_dfbbae2a061324758187624f2e0e54df" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence: 1929, Feb 6 - 1930, Jan 6.</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1929/1929">1929</unitdate><container id="aspace_b35c9d827cc431e120094fa2a1266c1d" label="unspecified" type="reel">39</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_3a1e69fca5b0ac52a1eeffb83d7b2e6a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The year 1929 was dominated by the Association's attempt to institute workmen's compensation in the few southern states without it. The curtailment of contributions made the financial conditions even more critical than usual. Andrews was hard-pressed to match the Chadbourne pledge. The AALL's first mid-year annual meeting was organized in March. In May, and throughout the year, Andrews corresponded with John R. Commons and others concerning a very extensive study by the Association of labor law administration in the United States. Later that month Frances Perkins appointed Andrews to the Governor's Commission on Unemployment Problems in New York State. Andrews' attacks on a new appointee to the United States Employees Compensation Commission upset Fiorello La Guardia, who wrote to Andrews that the man in question "...may not have a college degree but he does have a heart." (6/11/29) The Association's relationship with the International Longshore-men's Association suffered when the new president, Joseph Ryan, was displeased by Andrews' actions in the union's behalf (6/20/29).

The curtailment of contributions made the financial conditions even more critical than usual. Andrews was hard-pressed to match the Chadbourne pledge. The AALL's first mid-year annual meeting was organized in March. In May, and throughout the year, Andrews corresponded with John R. Commons and others concerning a very extensive study by the Association of labor law administration in the United States. Later that month Frances Perkins appointed Andrews to the Governor's Commission on Unemployment Problems in New York State. Andrews' attacks on a new appointee to the United States Employees Compensation Commission upset Fiorello La Guardia, who wrote to Andrews that the man in question "...may not have a college degree but he does have a heart." (6/11/29) The Association's relationship with the International Longshore-men's Association suffered when the new president, Joseph Ryan, was displeased by Andrews' actions in the union's behalf (6/20/29). Congressman G. W. Norris wrote Andrews (6/22/29) that Ryan informed him that the Longshoremen were not behind the legislation that Andrews had requested Norris to introduce. William Doak wrote (7/5/29) in regard to compensation for railroad workers that some of the men were too strongly opposed to it for the union to favor such legislation.

Ida Tarbell requested background information (1/28/30) for an article on vocational rehabilitation. The Association's work in New York State was largely in the form of lobbying for control of fee-charging employment agencies. Andrews was discouraged by the long fight against such agencies and wrote Joseph Chamberlain (3/13/30) that if AALL could not get that bill passed this year, it might just as well give it up. Fred Wilcox, Chairman of the New York State Committee on Unemployment Problems, sent Andrews a copy of the committee's report (3/25/30). Financial conditions continued to create severe constraint on the Association's activity, and Thomas Chadbourne informed the Association (4/7/30) that he would not be able to renew his annual gift of $10,000. A mid-year meeting was held in conjunction with the National Con-ference of Social Work. The AALL's program included workmen's compensation, social insurance, old age pensions and unemployment remedies. April through June saw concentrated work on the unemployment relief bills that Robert Wagner had introduced. Wagner informed Andrews (5/28/30) that these bills should be passed before the Association's unemployment insurance bill was introduced.</p></scopecontent></c01><c01 id="aspace_99bbc5219195415637db1b3bb64a63b7" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence: 1930 June 1 - Nov 12.</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1931/1931">1931</unitdate><container id="aspace_6e0b546f2df98d310d8cb23ca4e48965" label="unspecified" type="reel">42</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_b0cc00882647559f7356b195c47f6bff"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Unemployment problems and their solution dominated the activities of the summer and fall of 1930.

John Andrews, John Fitch, Grace Coyle, Mary Drier, Rose Schneiderman, and many others formed a committee to push unemployment insurance in the New York State legislature under the auspices of the AALL. Governor Roosevelt requested John Andrews' concrete proposals to fight unemployment (12/29/30). The new year brought the involvement of even more people in the Association's plans for unemployment insurance. Paul Raushenbush wrote from Wisconsin that he and Elizabeth Brandeis had ideas about the unemployment problem and wished to cooperate with the AALL. His letter (1/8/31) began many years of correspondence with Andrews on this subject, ending only with Andrews' death. Under discussion was the Association's "American Plan for Unemployment Insurance," a plan that featured no contribution to the fund on the part of the employees. William Doak, newly appointed United States Secretary of Labor, accepted the vice-presidency of the AALL on January 17, and a few weeks later (2/2/31) resigned because of the Association's advocacy of the Wagner employment bills.</p></scopecontent></c01><c01 id="aspace_f56ef2565ddf6e209a15eeac4b49dc2b" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence: 1931, Feb 6 - June 2.</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1931/1931">1931</unitdate><container id="aspace_2bcf25475d0381eb79df40a7b0a00c9f" label="unspecified" type="reel">44</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_27d0a447e88adf0abe6e20d06babfa2c"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The Association's activities in the spring of 1931 were evenly distributed between unemployment relief and workmen's compensation for the southern states still without it.

Roosevelt wrote to Andrews (3/19/31), asking him to serve on a commission to solve the problem of inadequate medical aid for compensation cases. Later, Andrews wrote Roosevelt, urging that he not sign the bill authorizing private corporations to sell unemployment insurance.

A letter to Ernest Draper (11/10/32) deals with the National Committee on Unemployment Reserves, a satellite of the AALL. The problem of how to invest unemployment reserve monies also received wide attention. Mary E.

The AALL program for 1934 included sponsorship of legislation providing unemployment reserves, amendment of workmen's compensation, and public employment offices. In February Edwin E.

By 1933, it was down to $37,000 with a deficit of about $1,000. The lack of funds seriously curtailed the Associations work. Isador Lubin informed Andrews (5/22/34) about the President's quandry on the Wagner-Lewis bill and the President's plan to appoint a "royal commission" to report on needed social legislation. Edwin E. Witte wrote Andrews (6/19/34) that he found President Roosevelt's message on social insurance too vague, and that he might discourage state legislation on this issue.

Andrews sent the Walsh-Healy Bill to the Rhode Island Federation of Labor (12/22/38). During the first three months of 1939, amendments to the interstate workmen's compensation bill were prepared. Andrews sent Robert Wagner (1/22/39) amendments to the interstate workmen's bill which he hoped Wagner would approve and reintroduce. Frances Perkins replied (1/27/39) to Andrews' note in regard to the Harry Bridges case: "It helps a great deal to hear from one's . . ." John A. Kratz (2/24/39) gave Andrews credit for the original passage of the Vocational Rehabilitation Act and thanked Andrews for his suggestions. Andrews also wrote to Harold Ickes (2/25/39) and (3/1/39), making suggestions for improved administration of vocational rehabilitation.</p></scopecontent></c01><c01 id="aspace_63e84fe1c92a70f46d87b4039a39902d" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence: 1939, Mar 21 - 1940, May 18.</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1939/1940" type="inclusive">1939-1940</unitdate><container id="aspace_b40512436a11e0e83cd69a852d36501d" label="unspecified" type="reel">58</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_c5da181b55a8f14ca264bd69fac4330c"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Mine safety was a key issue in late 1939 and the beginning of 1940. D. Harrington contacted Andrews about the disaster at the Duvin mine near Providence, Kentucky. Edwin E. Witte wrote Andrews (8/29/39) and Andrews replied (9/18/39) about revisions that Arthur J. Altmeyer forced Witte to make in an article. Andrews thought the changes were ridiculous. John L. Lewis complimented Andrews (2/10/40) on the letter the AALL distributed on the need for mine safety legislation, and asked Andrews to remove his name from the Association letterhead, as his policy did not permit his name to be used. The Director of the Department of Engineering of the United Mine Workers, Walter Polakov, also wrote, agreeing to cooperate with the AALL on improving mine safety regulations (2/20/40). Sidney Hillman wrote to John Andrews (4/1/40) about possible multi-shift regulations.</p></scopecontent></c01><c01 id="aspace_b2e1aebe1f8b2e4c39e984458bc2987b" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence: 1940, May 19 - 1941, May 31.</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1940/1941" type="inclusive">1940-1941</unitdate><container id="aspace_d108f4267f3d306e4059d3ee48cc4dd9" label="unspecified" type="reel">59</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_e6a6d9fccf5d8708b18a91672f52ab3a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>John Andrews wrote to the President (11/8/40), suggesting that Roosevelt's legislative program include completion of the health program by supporting social security protection, authorization of federal mine safety inspection, and the extension of workmen's compensation to all interstate employees. This was largely the AALL's program for 1941. Harold Ickes, Secretary of the Interior, wrote to Andrews (2/25/41) about federal mine inspection. The AALL sent a form letter (3/25/41) to the state departments of labor, asking about the failure of employers to insure their employees. In April, Andrews wrote to Merritt L. Gordon (4/14/41), relating the early years of the AALL. Andrews stated that he had attended the first organizational meeting in December 1905. Arthur J. Altmeyer wrote about the need for physical examinations for workers (5/8/41). Andrews outlined the new aims of the AALL in a letter to Professor H. Pillsbury Styles (5/8/41). He stressed federal health and disability insurance and the adoption of the federal mine inspection bill.</p></scopecontent></c01><c01 id="aspace_89d3b234c2b78d8ea7f7813c02971ad3" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence: 1941, June 1 - 1945, Dec 31, n.d. , fragments.</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1941/1945" type="inclusive">1941-1945</unitdate><container id="aspace_27d36520e000647bc7b9115daa608d51" label="unspecified" type="reel">60</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_004ee660dead3aa8d5676c96770aca0e"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Andrews wrote Morris Leeds and others (1/15/42) of his interest in regularizing the textile industry and stopping its practice of running three shifts for some weeks and then shutting down in others, The threat of the second world war was felt. Andrews cautioned the membership "to be watchful lest (by) their short-sighted good intention many of our labor laws be broken down" (2/1/42). Andrews complained to C. Edwin Gilmore (2/2/42) that "We are in a tidal sweep of federalization in the field of labor legislation." Plans for the annual meeting were discussed with Professor C. Clively in October (10/8/42), which suggested a joint meeting with the Rural Sociological Society on Mexican workers in the United States and the general need for extending social security protection to farm workers. One of Andrews' last letters in the collection, written shortly before his death, is to Barbara Peterson of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, explaining that for the first time the AALL's annual meeting would be cancelled ". . .on account of wartime conditions."</p></scopecontent></c01><c01 id="aspace_21647ba21221cf2084bc4ca8b60edfad" level="file"><did><unittitle>Organizational Materials</unittitle><unitid>1</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1906/1942" type="inclusive">1906-1942</unitdate><container id="aspace_f7b65ff686a036da146eb68d6dfb2fc7" label="unspecified" type="reel">61</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_5911dacf45565da76a03e73ccf55cb9f"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>and no date</p></scopecontent></c01><c01 id="aspace_de3a8a86c6acf01b075b4a7580eec206" level="file"><did><unittitle>General Labor Law</unittitle><unitid>2</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1909/1919" type="inclusive">1909-1919</unitdate><container id="aspace_d9cf892b758423541a7050385b7f2dac" label="unspecified" type="reel">61</container></did></c01><c01 id="aspace_9c24c2da6f8c6c297fef41bdfe59dd46" level="file"><did><unittitle>General Labor Law</unittitle><unitid>1</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1920/1943" type="inclusive">1920-1943</unitdate><container id="aspace_98d30a18e87d7c732e119daaeef0e43a" label="unspecified" type="reel">62</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_9e102fcac3d5a60de18520848a080f84"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>and no date</p></scopecontent></c01><c01 id="aspace_04ec1070a8048351a93a41e9d20f6484" level="file"><did><unittitle>General Social Insurance</unittitle><unitid>2</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1909/1937" type="inclusive">1909-1937</unitdate><container id="aspace_e22b81112f93c45c9e0cea227f745ab2" label="unspecified" type="reel">62</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_188a5507bf000224c87935c96bedf669"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>and no date</p></scopecontent></c01><c01 id="aspace_d278e5a20ebc5af22df00a5a75aeacdb" level="file"><did><unittitle>Health Insurance</unittitle><unitid>3</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1911/1917" type="inclusive">1911-1917</unitdate><container id="aspace_66a0cbe91b46032e1294d5af571ecc55" label="unspecified" type="reel">62</container></did></c01><c01 id="aspace_23b09de9989dbb7d377deac526acdf31" level="file"><did><unittitle>Health Insurance</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1917/1940" type="inclusive">1917-1940</unitdate><container id="aspace_43aad7edc29367bb579854a47ceb6bc0" label="unspecified" type="reel">63</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_db4f32eb766759390f9c752747d38788"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>and no date.
