    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>The Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen was founded on December 1, 1873 in Port Jervis, New York by Erie Railroad firemen in order to provide mutual support for railroad firemen. Their first convention was in 1874, at which they adopted their first constitution. The Brotherhood initially emphasized insurance, but by the late nineteenth century had branched out into labor-management relations. </p><p> In 1907, the organization changed its name to the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen [BLF&amp;E], reflecting the changes in its membership as former firemen were promoted to engineers and permitting locomotive engineers to join its ranks. In 1969, the union merged with the Order of Railway Conductors and Brakemen, the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, and the Switchmen's Union of North America to form the United Transportation Union [UTU]. </p><p> Lodge 807 of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen, now defunct, was located in Auburn, New York. It was composed of employees of the Lehigh Valley Railroad Company [LVRR] working on the Lehigh Valley, Auburn, Cortland, and Auburn-Ithaca branches. These employees were represented by Lodge 807 until its dissolution in 1966 at which point they were represented by Lodge 379, located in Sayre, Pennsylvania. After the merger of the railroad brotherhoods, they were represented by UTU Local 810. Finally, in the 1970s, the operating employees joined the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers [BLE], Division 380.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>Inclusive date range: 1911-1988 </p><p> Bulk dates: 1959-1979 </p><p> This collection consists of the files of William J. McLane, Local Chairman of BLFE Lodge 807 (Auburn, NY), Local Chairman of UTU Local 810 (Sayre, PA), and finally Local Chairman of BLE Division 380 (Sayre, PA) for the Auburn and Cortland, New York area employees of the Lehigh Valley Railroad. It primarily documents the history of Lodge 807, but its files also document the transitions its members went through during the downsizing and consolidation of both the carriers and of the operating brotherhoods. The records in this collection amply document the effects union consolidations and mergers had on the general membership. </p><p> The collection contains historical records from the founding of Lodge 807, including documentation of the founding of a new Lodge, the transfer of existing BLFE members from other Lodges into the newly formed Auburn, New York Lodge, the applications of Lehigh Valley Railroad Company [LVRR] Auburn Division to join Lodge 807, and correspondence with the Grand Lodge for guidance. Membership lists are attached to these pieces of correspondence. Of particular interest is a Ritual Book from 1945, offering instruction to members on how all ceremonies were to be performed in the Lodge. </p><p> This collection contains extensive records on the daily operations of a BLFE Lodge from the first half of the 20th century. Financial filings from 1958-1967 and the financial secretary's cashbook from 1937-1967 offer an in depth view of the Lodge's activities as well as complete membership rosters, and in the cases of insurance plans, the member's family and next of kin. These records, along with the seniority rosters for the railroad facilities, make this a rich resource for genealogists. </p><p> This collection also contains numerous case files resulting from grievances file by employees. The case files are instructive in that there are both those cases settled at the local level as well as cases that had to be forwarded to the sitting general chairman of the Grievance Committee to be further addressed. The correspondence that resulted from these cases extensively documents the relations between members at various levels in the BLFE's hierarchy. </p><p> This collection also documents the effect the crew consist dispute and the final decision of Arbitration Board No. 282 had on firemen and engineers. </p><p> Finally, this collection contains documentation of the effects the bankruptcies and consolidations of the carriers had on their employees and the unions that represented them.</p>  </scopecontent>
