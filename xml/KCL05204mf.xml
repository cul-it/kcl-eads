    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>The Southern Tenant Farmers' Union (STFU), a biracial union of sharecroppers, tenant farmers, and small landowners, came into existence in the cotton plantation country of Arkansas in July, 1934, under the leadership of a group of socialists, including H.L. Mitchell and Howard Kester. Although locals were soon established in Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas, Mississippi, and Alabama, the union's base of operation remained in Arkansas until 1945. </p><p> Farm mechanization and the impact of World War II shifted the union's focus from tenant farmers to migrant farm workers, whose numbers were rapidly increasing. The union also began supplying temporary cannery workers during the 1940's. </p><p> From 1937 to 1939, the STFU was affiliated with the CIO through the United Cannery, Agricultural, Packing and Allied Workers of America (UCAPAWA). After the STFU's withdrawal from the CIO in response to ideological differences with the UCAPAWA, it remained independent until it secured direct affiliation with the A.F. of L. in 1946. At that time, the organization's name changed to the National Farm Labor Union (NFLU) and organizing efforts shifted to farm workers in California. During the 1950's, the NFLU's successor, the National Agricultural Workers' Union (NAWU), focused on organizing sugar, rice, and strawberry workers in Louisiana. </p><p> In 1960, the NAWU surrendered its AFL-CIO charter and merged with the Amalgamated Meat Cutters and Butcher Workmen. H.L. Mitchell, former secretary of the SFTU, headed Local 300 of the Allied and Agricultural Workers' Union, organizing rice mill workers and fishermen in Louisiana.</p>  </bioghist>

The STFU experienced troubles within the ranks of its own leadership and was forced to expel both WH Stultz and J.O. Green. On the expulsions, see the injunction obtained against Stultz (June 17), an affidavit sworn by Stultz affirming his dire poverty (June 27) and the Constitution of Green's Fascist-style "Tenant Farmers' and Labors' Patriotic Union" (July 19). There is also an interesting communication from the Alabama Share Croppers Union on Green's attempt to subvert their strike.

There is a good deal of material concerning the union's attempt to gain representation at a conference called by Secretary of Agriculture Henry A. Wallace on the future of the AAA (Jan. 8 to 15). Another major topic is the situation at Parkin, Arkansas, where a mass eviction of tenants at the C.H.

In conjunction with this effort, the STFU undertook several surveys to determine the extent of the need for relief, including a survey of evictions (15) and a survey of union members refused WPA work relief (appears at the end of the month). Mitchell travelled to Washington with the preliminary results of the 1937 survey (see folder 225 above) in hand and reported on his trip to Butler (4 and 5). Internal dissension developed within the union, both in Oklahoma and Arkansas. The Oklahoma State Executive Committee listed its complaints (13) and Mitchell tried to straighten things out by correspondence with Odis Sweeden (14 to 16) and by a visit to a special STFU meeting on unemployment in Oklahoma (23 and 24). Late in the month, a group in Cross County, Arkansas formed the wild-cat "Arkansas Agricultural and Labor Association" and J.R. Butler responded with a hard-hitting circular letter to all STFU locals (28). There is also a summary of per capita tax paid to UCAPAWA by the STFU from October to December, 1937 (1); a "report to the International Executive Board, UCAPAWA" from Donald Henderson (18); and a copy of a letter from Barney Egan to his fellow CIO leader John Brophy on trouble between the Texas Pecan Shellers Union and UCAPAWA (26)</p></scopecontent></c02><c02 id="aspace_bb107e80426172df8fb08d71b2e68eeb" level="file"><did><unittitle>February, 1938</unittitle><unitid>3</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1938/1938">1938</unitdate><container id="aspace_7347b62cc04a339b958ef21f0ee78367" label="unspecified" type="reel">7</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_b1c7f8966f0e7ab8e60d19e71622d6dc"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Papers related to the 4th Annual Convention, held at Little Rock, Ark., from Feb. 25 to 27, include: the call and applications for delegates' credentials; instructions to the delegates; the convention program; STFU Constitution and By-Laws as revised by the convention; a typescript of the convention proceedings; "The Southern Tenant Farmers' Union in 1937", a report by H.L. Mitchell; and "One Bread, One Body", a play in three scenes by Lee Hays and Dan Burnett. All of these items are filed under the date of Feb. 25. In addition to the correspondence concerning the convention, there is a frequent exchange of letters between the STFU and Harriet Young of the WDL, planning for National Sharecroppers Week. There is some discussion of the Cross County wild-cat movement at the beginning of the month, including a detailed report from local leader Myrtle Lawrence (7). A new problem developed in Jefferson County, Ark., where STFU officials Claude Williams, Leon Turner, and E.B. McKinney attempted to reorganize the union in violation of STFU procedure. In this connection, see especially the report from J.W. Dillard (13) and Mitchell to Leon Turner (28). Finally, there is a reply from WPA on STFU complaints of union members refused relief work (24) and documents concerning three union members in the FSA program evicted from their homes (23)</p></scopecontent></c02><c02 id="aspace_40df8e5c048b6ddcb5784963efe8b91d" level="file"><did><unittitle>March, 1938</unittitle><unitid>4</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1938/1938">1938</unitdate><container id="aspace_9db08c53fa5561f7843b310a3215eb34" label="unspecified" type="reel">7</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_61370bb1cebecc34ce9906dd337cd977"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>National Sharecroppers Week was held from March 6 to 13; papers relating to it include a WDL leaflet (6), a report from Butler to Harriet Young on his NSW trip to the Mid-west (17), and a statement of receipts and disbursements from the WDL (29). Trouble continued in Jefferson County, and Ark. organizer D.A. Griffin reported on it at length (28). The STFU sent a copy of an anti-war resolution passed at its convention to a number of US Senators (24) and several replied (29 and 30).

One can trace this development in the papers, beginning with the call for an emergency meeting of the NEC (18), and continuing with the Minutes of the Convention of the Oklahoma STFU, which passed a special resolution on affiliation with UCAPAWA (23). There is a 2-page typescript, giving a brief history of the relations between the STFU and UCAPAWA (25), apparently related to the NEC emergency session, for which full Minutes appear (25). Finally, there is an incomplete set of Minutes of the International Executive Board meeting marked "Not Released" (29). Complaints to WPA over the work relief program continued (5, 14), and the agency replied to one earlier STFU complaint (19). Mitchell also telegrammed Secretary Henry A. Wallace again about the unfair cotton contracts circulating in the Delta (4), and Sam Franklin at the DCF sent the union further information on these contracts (7)</p></scopecontent></c02><c02 id="aspace_9484b0e3c235ffa1408dace78466631c" level="file"><did><unittitle>May, 1938</unittitle><unitid>2</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1938/1938">1938</unitdate><container id="aspace_11b35ae1d9ee656231b3215d15784cba" label="unspecified" type="reel">8</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_d04abf18d62190a83e24bcaab857ed76"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The fight with UCAPAWA began to heat up, and the reader may follow its progress through the letters which Mitchell wrote to his friends and allies, keeping them informed of events and outlining strategy. Other documents relating to the split include: a mimeographed letter to STFU locals, explaining the conflict with UCAPAWA (11; note: page 2 of this letter is missing); Minutes of a special NEC meeting which voted to withdraw from the International (21); "An Open Letter to the American Labor Movement....", announcing the NEC vote (21); a mimeographed letter from Henderson to STFU locals, enclosing an incomplete set of minutes for the UCAPAWA Board meeting (23); and Mitchell to Henderson, complaining that the minutes are incomplete (30). In addition to the materials on the split with UCAPAWA, there are a few items which shed light on the situation in Jefferson County, where trouble broke out in February (2,13).

Henderson's reply to Mitchell's complaints appears on July 29. The union continued to document cases of peonage in Arkansas by collecting affidavits (6,18,19,23); letters to the WDL supply additional information on the investigation (7,24). Two STFU projects got underway during June: A YM-YWCA project to bring students, both white and black, into Arkansas to give them firsthand knowledge of the lives of sharecroppers, and a project to organize the "Friends of the STFU" as part of the union's fund-raising effort</p></scopecontent></c02><c02 id="aspace_eb2c48b39ca7e8bba47ce1b7647273e4" level="file"><did><unittitle>July, 1938</unittitle><unitid>4</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1938/1938">1938</unitdate><container id="aspace_75b9416352f18a53215cac3c6c49ae4d" label="unspecified" type="reel">8</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_5fd330386886a600647970c11494c9ee"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Mitchell represented the STFU on the President's National Emergency Council in Washington; the papers include his statement (5) and a report to Butler on his trip (6).

McKinney, writing to Wiley Harris, a black organizer, claimed on the contrary that white leaders had no concern for the welfare of black members (29). Mitchell wrote two long letters to Gardner Jackson, one giving an account of the battle with UCAPAWA (9) and the other on plans to organize a chapter of Labor's Non-Partisan League in Arkansas (18). Odis Sweeden voiced the complaints of the Oklahoma STFU against Memphis Headquarters in two detailed letters (22 and 23).

The reader may follow the progress of the demonstration in a flood of telegrams sent and received by union headquarters throughout the month, in two STFU press releases (14,23), in reports from F.R.

There are a number of important letters throughout the month by and about O.H. Whitfield, who shifted his support from the STFU to UCAPAWA. The papers include reports on the situation in Missouri from organizers F.R. Betton (8, 18) and J.F. Moore (12), as well as a flood of letters from the evicted sharecroppers themselves. One letter from Mitchell to Jack Herling gives especially detailed information on the situation (10). The correspondence also concerns the union's efforts to obtain relief for the demonstrators from Northern contributors and the FSA; in this connection, see the Financial Statement for the Southeast Missouri Relief Fund, which contains a list of contributors (18), and a letter from R.C. Smith, Regional Director of FSA, on his agency's efforts (27). Papers related to the UCAPAWA fight appear throughout the month and include: letters from Donald Henderson to STFU organizers, (23); a four-page mimeographed "Analysis of UCAPAWA" apparently prepared by the STFU (14); a letter from Gardner Jackson, advising Mitchell to comply with Henderson's various requests (21); and approximately 30 returns to an STFU questionnaire on the status and condition of all locals (17).</p></scopecontent></c02></c01><c01 id="aspace_ce9d44f4b350944403d67d9f48a4811d" level="file"><did><unittitle>March 1939 to June 1939.</unittitle><container id="aspace_eca7aaeb79cbb9b37332de122d2bfde8" label="unspecified" type="reel">11</container></did><c02 id="aspace_6658e7618c14aa0204d8f507a5f7c1ef" level="file"><did><unittitle>March, 1939</unittitle><unitid>1</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1939/1939">1939</unitdate><container id="aspace_7bf06a072c958d5e34e73a7d20549f90" label="unspecified" type="reel">11</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_66e9b54b7da48a568e749aeab23eb95b"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The STFU withdrew from UCAPAWA on March 12, and virtually all of the papers for March have to do with the split. A chronology of the correspondence and events leading up to the withdrawal is especially helpful (11). Returns from a membership referendum on withdrawal appear throughout the month. Advice poured in from friends of the union, including Ward Rodgers (3), Howard Kester (3), Gardner Jackson (13,31), Matthew Woll, Third Vice-President of the AF of L (29), and from two AF of L leaders in Texas and California who complained of Communism in the CIO (18, 22). John Brophy, Director of the CIO, attempted to mediate, but his efforts proved of no avail (8 to 11). Three letters from Mitchell are of special interest, one to Butler outlining strategy (3), one to Lucy Randolph Mason stating that the STFU had no quarrel with the CIO itself (30), and a five-page letter to The Nation explaining the STFU side of the controversy (30). Donald Henderson held a special convention in St. Louis to reorganize the Missouri STFU and Joyce Crawford reported on it at length (13). Odis Sweeden reorganized the Oklahoma STFU into the Oklahoma Tenant Farmers Union; the papers include the Constitution and the program adopted at Sweeden's convention (19). The STFU held its own special convention in Memphis on March 19; although the resolutions adopted there do appear (19) there is no record of the Proceedings in the papers. To protect NSW from UCAPAWA, Mitchell and Harriet Young decided to set it up as a non-profit corporation; the papers include the legal forms for incorporation (14, 15, 17)</p></scopecontent></c02><c02 id="aspace_1458bba9814d826e8201c58bfb6325b5" level="file"><did><unittitle>April, 1939</unittitle><unitid>2</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1939/1939">1939</unitdate><container id="aspace_a757a6fe2e05aa66c5ec0f88e361e3c3" label="unspecified" type="reel">11</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_a6b6d84521e8ac964ff6689d2e7d5236"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Donald Henderson held a UCAPAWA convention in Memphis on April 2; the papers include a UCAPAWA handbill and an STFU press release on Mitchell's walk-out from the convention (2). Other items related directly to the feud with Henderson include an injunction obtained by the STFU to prevent UCAPAWA from organizing under the STFU's name (5), as well as two long letters from Mitchell to Gardner Jackson and Norman Thomas (3, 10). The Oklahoma STFU was especially weakened by the split; efforts to rebuild it can be traced in field reports from W.R. Purcells and Guy Thomas (1,2,30), as well as in Mitchell's report from Okla. of April 21. The Delta Cooperative Farm hosted a Southern Socialist Conference on April 7 to 9; related items include a mimeographed report on the conference (7) and a long letter from Norman Thomas to the Conference on building the Socialist Party in the South (5). Two union members were beaten by Sheriff's Deputies at Crawfordsville, Ark., on April 15; there is heavy correspondence relating to this outbreak of violence during the remainder of the month, but see especially the affidavits of the victims (24). Correspondence concerning NSW appears throughout the month and includes the Final Financial Statement for 1939 (28). There are a number of replies from the FSA to STFU complaints (20,21,27), and there is scattered correspondence about the union's search for a new Educational Director</p></scopecontent></c02><c02 id="aspace_83e6238aa9cb36f1af11cc309756c9d7" level="file"><did><unittitle>May, 1939</unittitle><unitid>3</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1939/1939">1939</unitdate><container id="aspace_2104cc79993fa8f46bb135a2d377295a" label="unspecified" type="reel">11</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_958b406b373549c826c818bd7d295d1c"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The work of repairing the union continued during May.

The union attempted to pressure Prosecuting Attorney Bruce Ivy to investigate the violence at Crawfordsville, but Ivy proved evasive (13,16,26). Also of special interest are two letters from J.E. Clayton on his plan to purchase the Lowden plantation near Gould, Ark. to resettle black sharecroppers (4,6,and June 9) and two long letters from J.C.

Another major issue was a request from the Farm Workers' Allied Union, which had started organizing in the San Joaquin Valley in California, for affiliation with the STFU (19, 23, 28); see especially a report on the new union from J.B.

A bitter personal controversy arose among the STFU organizers in Oklahoma; one can follow it in the letters of Henry Pippin, Guy Thomas, and W.R. Purcells. Also, in relation to Oklahoma, there are no less than seven letters from former state President Odis L. Sweeden asking Butler to rehire him as an organizer. Butler wrote all locals, asking them to fill out a questionnaire form on the desirability of holding a wage scale conference; Butler also wrote Mitchell on the same day explaining why he opposed such a conference (14).

Many of the workers expressed satisfaction with what they found, but the Rev. David S. Burgess, in a five-page letter to Clinton Golden of the WMC Labor-Management Committee, depicted scenes of considerable squalor in the migrant workers' camps (19). Further shipments to Florida were delayed due to lack of housing for white workers; on this and other difficulties, see Mitchell to WMC Executive Director Arthur S. Fleming (8), Mitchell's report to the GEC on his trip to Washington (12), and his circular letter to the union's organizers (24). There are two conflicting reports on the trouble at Camp 90, McNary, Texas, one from the FSA (4) and one from J.W. Mack, the STFU representative at the camp (10).

Mitchell sent letters to a number of prominent labor leaders, asking their help in fighting the bill (15 to 17). Mitchell went to Washington on Jan. 22 to work against the bill; his report to the GEC summarizes his activities (30).

The reader may follow the progress of the case through the letters of Cotton plant lawyer Ross Mathis (11,13,16,25) and through a "statement of facts" on the case (n.d. [August, 1944]). Rev. David S. Burgess, employed by the Congregational Church as a minister to migrant workers, sent two lengthy reports on the condition of the men who did get to Campbell Soup Co. (22,30). There are several replies from labor leaders in California to Mitchell's inquiries concerning jobs in the canning industry in their state (21 to 30). Finally, an extremely valuable chart appears at the end of the month; it lists all shipments of STFU workers sent outside the South from Nov., 1943 to August, 1944, with a breakdown by company, number, age, sex, race, and regular occupations</p></scopecontent></c02><c02 id="aspace_3065a1051a20af16f7284bf24d01d553" level="file"><did><unittitle>September, 1944</unittitle><unitid>4</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1944/1944">1944</unitdate><container id="aspace_e95d31ae3443602dd9b1ade0e14a4bcd" label="unspecified" type="reel">27</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_9dae27cd47d896a8624a8136f6b01a81"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The correspondence with California union leaders noted in the previous month continued during September.

During the first few months of 1946, the major topic is the attempt to roll back the USDA wage ceiling for cotton workers. During the summer, the STFU, which had changed its name to the National Farm Labor Union (NFLU) became affiliated with the AF of L; the formal NFLU request for affiliation is dated August 14. Also during the summer, the union became embroiled in a furious fight with the FTA-CIO over the seasonal employment of NFLU members at the Campbell Soup Co. in Camden, NJ. The CIO union threatened to strike the plant if NFLU workers were hired, and the NFLU retaliated with charges that the FTA-CIO was Communist-led. The National Farmers Union also became involved in the conflict, which ended when the company gave in to the CIO demands. On this subject, see the affidavit of George Stith, the NFLU representative at Campbell (Sept. 14). At the end of the year, the union started a campaign to stop the illegal entry of Mexican Nationals into Texas, where they were used to depress the wage standards of American farm labor; see especially the detailed letter from a U.S. Customs Patrol inspector at Alpine, Texas to Mitchell on why his service was unable to stop the "wetback" immigration (Dec. 9)</p></scopecontent></c02><c02 id="aspace_c8aabb691809fd8d96bee321f9c39128" level="file"><did><unittitle>No Date, 1946</unittitle><unitid>2</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1946/1946">1946</unitdate><container id="aspace_dddbaa971a9918194af7a4fad7bae2da" label="unspecified" type="reel">32</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_387726e3e18ceeea528d578e02bd6351"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>"Draft for a Union Farm Agreement"; press releases on the appointment of Barney B.

Fortunately, Mitchell typed up detailed memoranda after each of the crucial meeting held during the crisis; the papers include memoranda on Mitchell's conversations with Reuther include memoranda on Mitchell's conversations with Reuther and A. Philip Randolph (Jan 6), with the AMC and UPWA over a possible merger with NAWU (Jan 19), with Victor Reuther (Jan 25), with Walter Reuther again (Feb 25), with George Meany (March 3), and with AWOC Director Norman Smith (March 9).
