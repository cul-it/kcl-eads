<p>William Butler Ogden, a railroad investor (b. 1805), took over the Madison and Beloit Railroad in Wisconsin, extended the lines and later, after the financial troubles of 1857, reorganized the line into the Chicago and North Western Railway, into which the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad was also merged.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>The Chicago and North Western Transportation Company [CNW] was a Class I railroad in the Midwestern United States, often called the North Western. The CNW also called itself the "Pioneer Railroad," because one of its predecessor lines, the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad, was the first railroad to run out of Chicago. The railroad operated more than 12,000 miles of track in seven states (Wisconsin, Iowa, Nebraska, South Dakota, Illinois, Missouri, and Michigan) before retrenchment in the late 1970s. At the height of the railroad era, the CNW was one of the most profitable of the Midwestern railroads and one of the longest railroads in the United States because of mergers with other railroads, such as the Chicago Great Western Railway, Minneapolis and St. Louis Railway and others. </p><p> The CNW's earliest predecessor, the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad [GCU], was chartered in 1836. In 1848, it operated the first steam locomotive out of Chicago. Despite this early success, the GCU had many problems, including an inability to build tracks to Galena, Illinois, one of its supposed terminals, and instead had to rely on an interchange built by the Illinois Central to reach the city. These problems led to it being purchased by William Butler Ogden. Ogden was the first mayor of Chicago and a railroad investor. Ogden had already taken over the Madison and Beloit Railroad in Wisconsin and extended its lines. After the financial trouble of 1857, Ogden founded and incorporated the CNW. The CNW was chartered on June 7, 1859, by the legislatures of Illinois and Wisconsin. Five days previously, it had purchased the bankrupt Chicago, St. Paul and Fond du Lac Railroad. Ogden now controlled numerous roads in the Midwest; by 1865, they were merged into one system, the CNW, with over 850 miles of track. Ogden left the company in 1868 and became president of the Union Pacific. This was after one of CNW's predecessor lines, the Cedar Rapids and Missouri River Rail Road, had reached Council Bluffs, Iowa, in 1867, establishing a direct interchange with the Union Pacific, the first transcontinental railroad. By the end of the 19th Century, the CNW operated on over 7,000 miles of track, connecting such cities as Chicago, Omaha, Milwaukee, Duluth, Rapid City and the Twin Cities. </p><p> The CNW opened its Proviso Yards in Chicago in 1929. This facility was the largest of its kind when it was built, containing 224 miles of tracks and a huge diesel shop. The CNW was a "granger" railroad, primarily serving agricultural businesses. Potatoes were ones of its main crops, and the Potato Sheds in its Wood Street Yards were the largest in the world. It also did extensive business in transporting sugar beets, corn and wheat. The CNW also operated extensive passenger lines, including serving as one of the main commuter lines for Chicago. </p><p> The CNW was unique among American railroads in that it ran on a left-hand main, which meant that traffic was routed to the left instead of to the right. This was common among railroads built by British companies, but not among American ones. </p><p> The CNW was badly affected by the Great Depression, declaring bankruptcy in 1935 and not emerging until 1944 with the surge in traffic that happened because of the mobilization of men and goods for World War II. </p><p> The post-war period saw another sharp decline in the CNW's profits, as freight increasingly moved to the highways and the CNW had a large amount of secondary trackage that was a massive drain on the company since the industries on these lines no longer used the rails to ship their goods. However, even with this reality, the CNW still made major acquisitions in the late 1950s and 1960s, gaining control of the Litchfield and Madison Railway in 1958, the Minneapolis and St. Louis Railway in 1960, and the Chicago Great Western Railway in 1968. </p><p> In 1972, the CNW was sold to its employees and renamed the Chicago and North Western Transportation Company. In 1985, the employee owned stock of the company was transferred to the newly formed CNW Corporation, ending the employee owned period. By 1995, track sales and abandonment had reduced the total mileage of the CNW to about 5,000 miles. The company was purchased by Union Pacific [UP] in April 1995 and ceased to exist as an independent entity.</p>  </bioghist>

One set, from the Association of Western Railways [AWR], contains updates on agreements member carriers have entered into with various labor organizations. They also contain the text of the Agreements. AWR Circulars also contain information on decisions by various boards of adjustments based on interpretations of the previously mentioned agreements. Some of the circulars have attached correspondence, discussing how these interpretations affect either the carrier or their employees. </p><p>  The second set of circulars come from the CNW itself. These circulars, issued by the personnel department, inform employees about updates and changes to the Rules, Agreements, and Schedules made between the carrier and the various labor organizations that represent the employees in negotiations. The circulars also interpret the changes, and inform the different classes of employees how the changes affect them.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_b55990575624bbb638e9e5ca2eae9358"

It includes both blank and completed forms for both the Carriers' Conference Committee and the Association of Western Railways. These spread sheets contain information on the types of motive power used by the M&amp;St.L, the repairs made on the engines, the types of rolling stock used, and a rosters of both engines and rolling stock. These statistics are all for the month of December 1948. There are also spreadsheets documenting the number of trips made by different divisions of the M&amp;St.L in August 1930. There are also reports on accidents. </p><p>  Of interest are the two blank questionnaires designed to test aspiring firemen and engineers on their knowledge of different types of motive power.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_2f81b1ccaded9dc205b24319528e3515" level="file"><did><unittitle>Questionnaire on the Operation of Freight Diesels 445 and 545.

These employees belonged to the International Association of Machinists; the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, Iron Ship Builders, and Helpers of America; the International Brotherhood of Blacksmiths, Drop Forgers and Helpers; the Amalgamated Sheet Metal Workers International Alliance; International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers; and the Brotherhood of Railway Carmen of America. This series includes documentation on who represented the non-operating employees, including a decision by the U.S. Railroad Labor Board regarding the representation, and the Constitution and By-Laws of the M&amp;St.L Railroad System Association, Federated Shop Crafts AFL, which was deemed the representative organization instead of the American Federation of Railroad Workers. The complete filing of the 1921 case, including a transcript of the testimony before the U.S. Railroad Labor Board, is found in this series. </p><p>  Of particular interest is the documentation of the Great Railroad Strike of 1922, also called the Shopmen's Strike. This strike, which occurred in July and August 1922, was a nationwide strike launched by seven of the sixteen railroad labor organizations in existence of the time and the largest railroad work stoppage since the Pullman Strike of 1894. This series contains records of the financial losses suffered by the M&amp;St.L as well as a timeline of strike activities that occurred on their properties. </p><p>  Reports on conferences and Agreements between the M&amp;St.L and the Federated Shop Crafts are also located in this series. Also found are changes to the agreement with regards to the seniority rights of employees who served in the military during the course of their employment.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_8f62d104c68964880c7b10d52fa61897" level="file"><did><unittitle>Memorandum of Agreement Covering Mechanics' Seniority After Military Service.</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1945/1953" type="inclusive">1945-1953</unitdate><container id="aspace_81aa9221cf4da31725f81e18ffa46fac" label="unspecified" type="box">4</container><container id="aspace_bd97c9fd3db6f9d454859f8e72b63ce6" parent="aspace_81aa9221cf4da31725f81e18ffa46fac" type="folder">7</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_19bc2fa4c05559acafc177ae1856f2cc"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Association of Western Railways Circular Nos. 246 in re Advancement of apprentices, etc. to position of Mechanic.

The manuals cover different aspects of railroad employment. Some are personnel focused, such as the manuals on interviewing, salary administration, and workforce reductions; the directories of payroll numbers and disability ratings also focus on personnel matters. Instructional matters are also covered, both in the manual on preventing workplace mishaps and in the routing guides, which instruct employees on interchanges with other railroads. Finally, a bound volume containing the proceedings of the American Association of Railroad Superintendents' annual conference is also located in this collection.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_c16ffb005b4411349551438354acf9a0" level="file"><did><unittitle>Provisional Occupational Disability Rating Schedule.

It is overseen by the National Mediation Board, which was created by the 1934 amendment to Railway Labor Act to oversee the arbitration of labor disputes in the railway and airline industries. The NRAB is tasked with arbitrating minor disputes, i.e. grievance arbitrations, in the railway industry. This series contains the NRAB's decision in cases that either affected labor relations on the M&amp;St.L system, or cases that directly involved M&amp;St.L personnel. The latter are all cases of employees' claims for wages, filed by the Switchmen's Union of North America [SUNA].</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_7d3f1cdc0fc6d360ba74ba7340dd5604" level="file"><did><unittitle>National Railroad Adjustment Board.

It began in the late 1950s with the approval of the merger between the Norfolk and Western with The Virginian Railway. The culmination of the railroad merger era was the merger of the Pennsylvania Railroad with the New York Central Railroad in 1968, forming the Penn Central Transportation Company. </p><p>  This series contains some of the Agreements of the Penn Central merger, as well as copies of Agreements from other large carrier mergers. These records are present because they were used as templates for the Agreements used in CNW's merger with Chicago Great Western Railway in 1968. The various Consolidation Agreements demonstrate how complicated and unwieldy this process was, and helps demonstrate why the majority of these mergers resulted in larger carrier companies declaring bankruptcy and led to the deregulation of the industry and the creation of national corporations ConRail and Amtrak which operated on what had been the Penn Central's tracks.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_5d3e86ff0e756b75df3abcdc1ef35a95" level="file"><did><unittitle>Merger Protective Agreement and Implementing Agreement No. 1 Between The Great Northern Pacific and Burlington Lines, Inc. and Its Employees Represented by the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1966/1967" type="inclusive">1966-1967</unitdate><container id="aspace_5831bfb51227058ed79bc891bf690125" label="unspecified" type="box">5</container><container id="aspace_c8404371b80c31661ac3ca2cf53bcbe6" parent="aspace_5831bfb51227058ed79bc891bf690125" type="folder">15</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_c791c7b806c35a16588555b86f3516f1"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Consolidation of seniority districts, of terminal services, of terminals through attrition and other means, passenger service, zones, and schedules.</p></scopecontent></c02><c02 id="aspace_125b4ad6f24986a2e90120b2862fe023" level="file"><did><unittitle>Penn Central Merger: Yard Agreement No. 4.

The bulk of the records come from the Rules Movement of 1958, but other years are represented. The National Rules Movement were efforts by the railroad labor organizations to change operating rules for railroad employees. The Rules Movement of 1950 was concerned with moving to a 40-Hour week from a 48-Hour week with no reduction in pay. The 1958 Rules Movement was concerned with the operation of rules establishing time limits for the handling of claims and grievances; hiring practices; safety, health, and sanitation; and, accidents. Other issues addressed in Rules Movements of 1958 include vacation and holiday agreements. </p><p>  The records in this series include Section 6 Notices, in which the Unions notify the carriers of their desire to change the language of their Agreements; records of conferences had between the two sides to negotiate changes; and, circulars from carriers' conference informing other member railroads of changes made to Agreements. </p><p>  Of interest are records regarding the efforts of the American Railway Supervisors Association to organize supervisory officials, such as supervisors engaged in mechanics departments of various railroads. The negotiations and Agreements between carrier and labor organization were then subject to the changes requested by the Federated Shop Crafts during the Rules Movement.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_305ef42f0eb3374b578d6d6ee9c38091" level="file"><did><unittitle>National Mediation Board.

Local Agreements, Conferences, and Reports, 1926-1960</unittitle></did><scopecontent id="aspace_44d9451423ed55126845641cb28728a6"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This series contains records of the local agreements the M&amp;St.L had with various railroad labor organizations. Also included are reports of conferences between the local representatives of the labor organizations and the M&amp;St.L representatives. These agreements are interesting because of their focus on smaller and more local concerns that are not always represented in the national agreements. Many of these records are about the M&amp;St.L facility on Fort Dodge, Iowa. Of particular interest are the blue prints for a proposed office building, maps of the train yards, and an attempt by the M&amp;St.L to rent space from the Illinois Central Railroad to defray the costs of maintaining their own facilities. </p><p>  Also located in this series is a folder containing articles and essays on the issue of featherbedding. Featherbedding is the practice of hiring more workers than are needed to perform a given job. The term is often used by management to refer to labor union contracts which require them to keep a certain number of staff employed, even in instances in which they are no longer needed, such as with the rise of automated workflows that render certain positions obsolete. Certain local agreements are also filed with theses clippings, presumably because the M&amp;St.L felt that these Agreements were example of the same. </p><p>  Of particular interest is a file regarding the use of Edifone Equipment to record formal investigations. It is included in this series because it was a policy adopted by the M&amp;St.L and agreed upon by the various locals. However, the introduction of this equipment is indicative of the effects automation began to have on the work, particularly with regard to the clerks and stenographers employed by the M&amp;St.L.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_5ae1f59c3ac8b178162a0cff01eb60d8" level="file"><did><unittitle>Reports on Conferences between Minneapolis and St. Louis Railway and BLF&amp;E</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1958/1959" type="inclusive">1958-1959</unitdate><container id="aspace_984b6d5b702aaabfbcaa792b44a61c2a" label="unspecified" type="box">5</container><container id="aspace_2cc4417e8a633d46c709b9d3e656fdfe" parent="aspace_984b6d5b702aaabfbcaa792b44a61c2a" type="folder">43</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_220068d50255486c723e04d48308bf03"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>In re amending agreements to include Ft.
