    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>New York State United Teachers (NYSUT) was created in 1972 by the merger of the New York State Teachers Association (NYSTA) and the United Teachers of New York (UTNY). NYSTA had been affiliated with the National Education Association (NEA), and UTNY with the American Federation of Teachers (AFT). UTNY was the statewide organization whose United Federation of Teachers (UFT), led by Albert Shanker, was the predominant teachers' union in New York City. In joining with United Teachers and affiliating with the AFT, NYSUT also became a member union of the AFL-CIO. </p><p> In 1976, NYSUT voted to disaffiliate with the NEA. Some locals left NYSUT and created the NYEA (New York Educators Association), which became the state affiliate for the NEA. In the early 1980s, NYEA changed its name to NEA-NY. </p><p> NYEA/NEA- NY viewed association with the AFL-CIO's industrial unions as undermining the professional image and independence of teachers. The two organizations also differed strongly on aspects of the governance structure, particularly with respect to ethnic minority representation, with NYSUT opposed to mandatory minimums. The rivalry between NYSUT and NYEA/NEA-NY in organizing new locals expended a great deal of resources for both labor organizations. </p><p> While competition with NYEA/NEA-NY was a constant focus of NYSUT's organizing efforts for teachers, NYSUT was also organizing college faculty members, nurses, and other non-teaching personnel. Once members were organized, NYSUT continued to advocate for teachers' and other workers' rights through contract support and legal services at the local level and political involvement at the state and federal levels, supporting candidates and legislation that protected funding, due process, and working conditions. </p><p> NEA-N Y merged with NYSUT in 2006, by which time NYSUT had grown to more than half a million members, becoming the largest union in New York State.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>Covers 2006-2010, with a few folders 1988-1991. In addition to records of NYSUT's Division of Research and Educational Services, which fell under the purview of the First Vice President, the files document the activities of Maria Neira more generally, in her role as a member of the NYSUT Board of Directors, Executive Committee, Cabinet, Officers' Committee, Administrative Committee, NYSUT Policy Council, National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, and the Education and Learning Trust. Meeting agendas and minutes of these entities are heavily featured, as well as speeches and reports prepared by Neira. Minutes and materials of NYSUT's political action arm, VOTE/COPE, and its lobbying group, the Committee of 100, are also included. Topics cover closing the academic achievement gap, credit recovery (attempts to allow students who missed class to make up course credit online, in order to graduate), charter schools, vocational training and other programs for non-college-bound students, and the state response to federal programs under presidents G. W. Bush and Obama, No Child Left Behind and Race to the Top, respectively.</p>  </scopecontent>
