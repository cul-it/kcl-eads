<p>U.S. Emergency Boards No. 130 (1960) and No. 145 (1962) were established to investigate and settle disputes involving the Akron and Barberton Belt Railroad and other carriers represented by Eastern, Western, and Southeastern Carriers' Conference Committees and certain employees represented by eleven cooperating (non-operating) railroad organizations. </p><p> Emergency Board No. 130 dealt with a dispute arising out of the vacations with pay, wages, and improvements in health and welfare plans. The Board recommended a general wage rate increase of five cents per hour, additional carrier contributions to dependent benefits and group life insurance, and a seventeen cents per hour, cost-of-living adjustment. </p><p> Emergency Board No. 145 was created to settle an impasse arising out of "section 6" notices served by the parties on each other, proposing changes in existing agreements. The organizations proposed a twenty-five cents per hour wage increase and six months advance notice of reduction in force. The Carriers' Conference Committees countered with a request for a wage reduction and the abolition of provisions which required more than 24 hours notice of reduction in force. The Board recommended a four cents per hour increase, effective immediately, plus a two and one-half per cent increase, effective three months thereafter. It also recommended a rule requiring not less than five working days notice of force reduction.</p>  </bioghist>
