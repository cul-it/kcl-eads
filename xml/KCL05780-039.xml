<p>Founded in 1900 by local union delegates representing about 2,000 members in cities in the northeastern United States, the ILGWU grew in geographical scope, membership size, political influence to become one of the most powerful forces in American organized labor by mid-century. Representing workers in the women's garment industry, the ILGWU worked to improve working and living conditions of its members through collective bargaining agreements, training programs, health care facilities, cooperative housing, educational opportunities, and other efforts. In 1995, the ILGWU merged with the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union (ACTWU) to form the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees (UNITE).</p>  </bioghist>

Bambace became a vice president and member of the ILGWU General Executive Board in 1956. She remained manager of the district when it was renamed the Upper South Department in 1957 and continued until her retirement in 1972. Bambace died in 1975.</p>  </bioghist>

<p>The Upper South Department of the ILGWU began as the Maryland-Virginia District. Established in 1942, this district covered Maryland, Virginia, and West Virginia. The Baltimore Joint Board was not directly affiliated with the Maryland- Virginia District, but the two entities worked together closely and both were supervised by ILGWU Vice President Charles Kreindler. Sam Caplan was the manager of the Baltimore Joint Board and member of Pressers' Local 362. The Maryland-Virginia District was renamed the Upper South Department in 1957. </p><p> Angela Bambace served as the first manager of the Maryland-Virginia District, and later the Upper South Department, until her retirement in 1972. During her tenure, Irwin Jaffe served as the assistant manager of the Maryland-Virginia District. Sol Hoffman was manager from 1972 to 1977. Peter Nadash succeeded Hoffman, and was director of the Upper South Department at the time of the ILGWU's merger with ACTWU in 1995. </p><p> Locals associated with the Upper South Department include: Local 233 Richmond, VA; Local 235 Lawrenceville, VA; Local 236 Appomattox, VA; Local 238 Farmville, VA; Local 248 Hebron and Sharptown, MD; Local 260 Princeton, WV; Local 263 Danville, VA; Local 400 Roanoke, VA; Local 401 New Castle, VA; Local 402 Bristol, VA; Local 416 Clarksburg WV; Local 418 Parkersburg, WV; Local 419 Lynchburg, VA; Local 422 Pt.

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The collection is arranged alphabetically by subject, company, organization or individual. There are agreements with local garment companies, files for organizations such as the AFL-CIO, and the American for Democratic Action (Angela Bambace was on the board of directors), information on other labor unions which the ILGWU worked with and supported during strikes through donations, correspondence with officers of the ILGWU including David Dubinsky, records of different departments (Eastern out of Town, Education, Legal, Political, Research), and various informal and official reports (such as the Upper South Education Dept. with information classes and costs). </p><p> Also with the records are documents detailing the expenses for strikes, minutes, agendas and proceedings for meetings and conferences of the Upper South Department, and rules, benefits and literature for the various Health Funds. There are numerous financial statements, assets and invoices for the Maryland Virginia District, Upper South Department, and Baltimore Joint Board. In fact, the collection consists of abundant material on the Baltimore Joint Board, and those interested in researching the Joint Board and Baltimore locals would find much information within this collection. Records of the Baltimore Joint Board include meeting minutes, financial statements, benefits and administration of the Health Fund, and correspondence to and from the manager. </p><p> A section of the collection contains files on manufacturing firms and garment companies within the jurisdiction of the Upper South Department. Included are contracts and agreements, grievances, and correspondence. Of particular note is the various contract disputes for the Kenrose Manufacturing Co. and the subsequent strike and dismissal of workers after the company opened a new plant in Ireland. </p><p> Another component to the collection is files for the various organizers and business agents of the Upper South Department. These files are arranged by individual and contain correspondence, organizing activities, expenses incurred while the organizers were on the road traveling, and an assortment of leaflets and flyers that were passed out or put in shops. Also included are the organizers weekly reports. These were forms filled out and turned in at the end of each week in which the organizer listed which shops were visited, how many workers were met, and how many union cards were sent out. The provided a day by day report of the organizer's activities. </p><p> While there are indeed folders devoted specifically to Bambace and her personal correspondence, letters, and awards, as the manager of the Department for numerous decades, the majority of all business correspondence, memos and reports originated from her as well. This is also true of the correspondence to and from Charles Kreindler, ILGWU vice president and manager of Local 25 Blouse and Waistmakers, NY who supervised the Departments and received reports. </p><p> Of particular interest is a folder of postcards, photos and v-mail, correspondence to and from ILGWU members who were serving in World War II. The men sent letters back to their locals and fellow union members, while the members and locals in turn responded by sending the men letters, copies of "Justice," and care packages. Much correspondence is from Pvt. L Benjamin Brager, who was the former secretary of Local 362 and who often addresses his letters "Dear ladies." </p><p> The records of the locals within the Department contain correspondence, financial statements, election material, rosters, and minutes of board meetings.
