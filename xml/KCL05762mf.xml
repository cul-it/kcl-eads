    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>First established in 1918 as the Woman in Industry Service, the Women's Bureau was made a permanent part of the Department of Labor by act of Congress in 1920. The Bureau was mandated "to formulate standards and policies which promote the welfare of wage-earning women, improve their working conditions, increase their efficiency, and advance their opportunities for profitable employment ...[with] authority to investigate and report to the said [Labor] Department on all matters pertaining to the welfare of women in industry."</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>Part 1 of the Bureau's records consist of four series summarizing its work from the time of its predecessor, the Woman in Industry Service, to the mid 1960's and providing regular summaries of the Bureau's activities and policy positions. These are: Monthly reports (1918-1948); Annual summaries (1922-1932); Conferences of the Women's Bureau (1918-1965); and speeches and articles prepared by Women's Bureau officers (1918-1958). </p><p> Monthly reports of the director of the Women's Bureau (1918-1948) begin with the Woman in Industry Service. Reports were submitted to the Secretary of Labor and summarize all of the Bureau's activities of the preceeding month. Major projects within each division are monitored, including progress on survey work for the studies eventually published in the BULLETIN. Reports also provide overviews of the Bureau's lobbying and legislative consulting activities, its consultations with private groups and businesses and labor representatives, as well as its public service and educational activities. </p><p> Annual summaries (1922-1932) provide summary material similar to that found in the monthly reports but emphasize the annual, rather than the monthly, perspective. </p><p> Conferences of the Women's Bureau (1918-1965) constitute the largest component of Part 1. The conferences document the key issues concerning the Bureau from one decade to the next, as well as the roles played by individuals, government agencies and private organizations. Included are conference transcripts, agenda, lists of participants, summary minutes and reports, speeches, and background correspondence relative to organizing the conferences. </p><p> Speeches (1918-1958) and articles (1918-1947) of Women's Bureau officers were prepared for a wide variety of audiences and media and demonstrate the Bureau's policy positions on a wide range of topics as well as the extent of its educational efforts.</p>  </scopecontent>
