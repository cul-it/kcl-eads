<p>On May 27, 1952, upon request from District 65, Distributive, Processing and Office Workers Union, The American Arbitration Association appointed David L. Cole to arbitrate the wage dispute between Distrlc 65 and Gimbel Brothers. The hearings began in New York City on July 17, 1952. </p><p> The issues in the dispute are concerned with wages (minima, progression, automatics) classifications, and changes in vacations and holidays. From February 1, 1952, when the contract came up for negotiation, until May, when Mr. Cole was called in, no agreement could be reached on the issues. Throughout this period, however, the employees remained at work. </p><p> The union maintains that the wages paid at Gimbels are far below the wages paid at comparable department stores, and that these wages are insufficient in terms of the present cost of living. Basically, the union is concerned with cutting down the wage differential which exists between Gimbels and the other large department stores in the city, by attempting to force Gimbels participate in industry-wide bargaining. The union is seeking a wage increase commensurate with increases in other department stores. The company claims that its financial condition prohibits a wage increase at the present time. The company also claims that it is impossible to make wage adjustments comparable to other stores; there are too many factors which must be taken into consideration - there is no simple relationship between the various stores.</p>  </bioghist>
