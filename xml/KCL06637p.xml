    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Farr Alpaca was incorporated under the general statutes, Nov. 13, 1873, with a capital of $250,000. The first meting of the promoters of the company was held just previous to the outbreak of the financial crisis in September, 1873, but, notwithstanding the general depression in business which followed, and the long-continued prostration of the trade of Bradford, England, the chief seat of the worsted industry, the company was firmly established, and has proved a decided success. The erection of the buildings, which are built of brick, was commenced in December, 1873; and six months after, a full range of goods was shown in New York, and at once took the front rank. In view of the depressed state of trade, it was deemed advisable to only partially equip the mill at the start, but the first goods shown were so well received that it was found necessary, in order to meet the demand, to at once fill up the mill to its full capacity,255 looms, (The equipment has since been increased to 360 looms, with a capacity of 3,750,000 yards per annum.) and duplicate combing, drawing, and spinning machinery was put in to enable the company to produce either lustre or soft goods. Special care is taken in the selection of raw materials; and all operations in dyeing and finishing (some of which are original) are conducted with a view of producing the brightest lustre and the clearest and most durable color.</p>  </bioghist>
