<p>William Doble was born October 25, 1904, in Exetes, Devon, England. He immigrated to the U.S. and found employment in the railroad industry. Doble was a member of the Blue Mason Lodge and the OPA Advisory Committee. </p><p> Doble joined the Brotherhood of Railroad Signalman of America in 1924. With only an elementary school education he rose through the ranks to the position of chief signalman and ultimately became General Chairman of the Brotherhood, for New York Central, Lines West. His jurisdiction extended to local unions of the Big Four, the Michigan Central Railroad, the New York Central Railroad, the Peoria and Eastern Railway, and, Foreman and Inspector of the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad. He served in the office of General Chairman from 1931 to 1962 (as far as could be discerned from the collection). From his desk in Ferndale, Michigan, he handled grievances and channeled labor-management relations. Doble functioned as the coordinator of subordinate locals' activities, grievance claims, and disputes concerning conditions of employment.</p>  </bioghist>
