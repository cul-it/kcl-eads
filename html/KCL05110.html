            <div class="para">Jacob Billikopf (Ph.D., University of Chicago, 1903) was a prominent figure in Jewish
               social work, an arbitrator and mediator, </div>
            <div class="para"> Billikopf served as superintendent of the United Jewish Charities in Milwaukee and
               Kansas City; as executive director of the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies in Philadelphia;
               as impartial chairman in the New York men's clothing industry; as chairman of the
               National Labor Board for the Philadelphia region during the 1930's and as chairman
               of the ladies' garment industry in Philadelphia. He was an important member of the
               boards of the New School for Social Research and of Howard University, and was a vice-president
               of the American Association for Social Security, among numerous other public service
               activities.</div>  </a>

            <p></p>
            
            <div class="para">The Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America was organized in December 1914, after
               the militant New York City locals of the United Garment Workers of America had been
               denied representation at that body's October convention. Although the purposes of
               the Union were expressed by its Constitution in terms of class struggle and worker
               solidarity, ACW leaders instituted a program of union-management cooperation based
               upon the experiences of the International Ladies' Garment Workers Union with the Protocols
               of 1910-13, and the UGW locals in New York and Chicago with the establishment of permanent
               arbitration machinery during the same period. </div>
            <div class="para"> A prototype of subsequent agreements in the men's clothing industry may be found
               in the Chicago Hart, Schaffner&amp; Marx agreements of 1911-1913, since they involved
               the Union and a single manufacturer, rather than the Union and the associated manufacturers
               of a particular geographical area, as was the case in the ladies1 garment industry.
               These agreements, however, differed from the majority of Amalgamated Clothing Workers'
               agreements in following the Protocol' s model of grievance machinery: "Clerks" for
               the workers and the employer attempted to settle disputes on the shop level. In cases
               of disagreement, the matter went to a "Board of Trade" (Board of Grievances) composed
               of equal numbers of representing both sides, but with an impartial chairman. Supreme
               authority was held by a Board of Arbitration, composed of a representative each of
               the Union and the manufacturer, and a third person not connected with the industry
               chosen by the other two. </div>
            <div class="para"> So complex a system was suitable for the Chicago market, where a few large manufacturers
               dominated the production of ready-to-wear clothing, or a market in which a strong
               association of manufacturers might be established. The men's clothing industry in
               New York City, however, was characterized by intense competition among numerous small
               manufacturers operating "inside" or "outside" shops, or both. Although several associations
               existed, their membership determined by type of garment produced (as Boys' Wash Suit
               Manufacturers' Association), geographical location (as the East Side Retail Clothing
               Manufacturers' Association), or the type of manufacturing involved (ready-to-wear,
               special order, or custom tailoring), none was strong enough to represent even a single
               sub-industry within the market. As a consequence, agreements of the New York locals
               with associations or with individual manufacturers, from the time of the general strike
               in the winter of 1912-1913, called for negotiations of grievances by a shop chairman
               and a representative of the particular employer involved. In case of disagreement,
               an impartial umpire was to be consulted, either as an individual arbitrator or as
               an Impartial Chairman of an Arbitration Board. (Short-lived experiments with other
               methods were made from time to time, as in the agreement of 1915-1916 with the American
               Clothing Manufacturers' Association, which provided for a "Board of Moderators" composed
               of three representatives of the Union, three of the Association, and three of the
               public.) </div>
            <div class="para"> Although strikes of short duration seemed to have been held before each new agreement
               was made, in each case the issues involved were wages and hours, or out-of-town contracting,
               rather than the grievance procedure. The "Impartial Chairman" system has functioned
               continuously and successfully whenever employers have been willing to bargain with
               the Amalgamated and to consider seriously its demands. When they have not, as during
               the 1920-1921 lockout by member firms of the Clothing Manufacturers' Association of
               New York, the result of a desire to return to a prewar "normalcy", amicable relations
               between workers and employers has been impossible. </div>
            <div class="para"> During the summer of 1919, a National Industrial Federation of Clothing Manufacturers
               was formed by manufacturers in the New York, Chicago, Rochester, and Baltimore markets,
               in an attempt to create machinery for regulating and stabilizing the entire men's
               clothing industry. Such a plan was not to be successful until the Federal Government
               interfered to form the Men's Clothing Code Authority under the National Recovery Administration
               in 1933. When the National Industrial Recovery Act was declared unconstitutional in
               May, 1935, however, the cooperative Code Authority was dissolved, and conditions in
               the industry reverted to those of 1932.</div>  </a>
