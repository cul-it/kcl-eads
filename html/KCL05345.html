            <div class="para">During the summer of 1905, Local Six of the International Typographical Union of New
               York City decided that they would demand an eight hour day when negotiating contracts
               for the following year. The Typothetae, an association of some 56 publishing houses,notified
               the union in early November that they would not sign a new contract when the old one
               expired on December 31, 1905. Meanwhile the union negotiated contracts with some 281
               publishing houses employing approximately 7,000 of the union's 8,000 members which
               included an eight hour day. On January 2, 1906, no new agreement having been signed,
               the members of Local Six ceased to work for the Typothetae. </div>
            <div class="para"> On February 28, 1906 the Typothetae appealed to the New York State Supreme Court
               for an injunction on the grounds that Local 6 members were using threats of intimidation
               and violence to persuade the non-union members of the Typothetae either to leave the
               job or join the union. The court issued an injunction on March 2 which restrained
               the union from using force but did not enjoin picketing. </div>
            <div class="para"> In April, counsel for the Association requested the court to cite certain officers
               and members of the union for contempt, because the acts the injunction restrained
               had not ceased. The court appointed a referee to take testimony and made recommendations.
               The referee found that a great many of the allegations of threats and intimidation
               were supported by the facts, and that some of the men were not aware that this was
               precisely what the injunction enjoined. The referee held that Patrick McCormick and
               the other officiers were responsible for explaining the meaning of the injunction
               to the membership. A mere reading of the injunction at a meeting attended by only
               1,000 of the union's members did not discharge this responsibility and they were,
               therefore, guilty of contempt for violating the injunction. </div>
            <div class="para"> The court fined the officers of the union $250 each and sentenced them to 20 days
               in jail. It also fined two members $100 each. This was the first time that officers
               of a union were held responsible for the acts of members of that union. The union
               appealed the decision to the New York State Appelate Court.</div>  </a>
