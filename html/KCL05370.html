         <div class="item">Brief, reply brief, and opinion argued before the United States District Court, District
            of Oregon [Civil Case No. 1686]. This suit was filed by Montgomery Ward to recover
            damages from motor carriers. The damages resulted from a strike and a secondary boycott
            of Montgomery Ward. The filings by the plaintifs and defendants date from 1951, the
            opinion of the presiding judge dates from 1953.</div>

            <div class="para">On December 7, 1940, the clerks and warehousemen at Montgomery Ward's Portland plant
               went on strike over the terms of settlement in a labor dispute. When the negotiations
               over the terms of settlement broke down on December 20, the Teamsters Union, representing
               the warehousemen, called for a general boycott of the goods being shipped to and from
               the plant. </div>
            <div class="para"> A contract clause in the Agreement between the Teamsters and the Carriers servicing
               Montgomery Ward stated that the Union was not in favor of sympathetic strikes and
               further provided that the Union would not interfere with interstate commerce or in
               the intrastate commerce moving over the lines of the operator. Despite the language
               in this provision, there were innumerable instances of direct coercion of employers
               and employees to restrict handling of Ward's merchandise. After a brief period of
               struggle with the boycott, the carriers abandoned all attempts to service Montgomery
               Ward. </div>
            <div class="para"> In addition to the general boycott, a secondary boycott was developed against the
               company which exhibited equal strength. Major oil companies refused to sell or deliver
               fuel oil to the plant, longshoremen refused to handle Ward's merchandise, the Post
               Office refused to handle any more goods than had been customary before the strike,
               and railroads did not switch cars onto Ward's sidings. </div>
            <div class="para"> Only after hearings before the Interstate Commerce Commission did the carriers resume
               service. Soon afterward, Ward's entered suit against the carriers involved in the
               strike and boycott in the District Court for recovery of damages that resulted. </div>
            <div class="para"> Since the case was not ruled on until 1953, the decision was more concerned with
               carrier liability than with the actual award of damages. The judge, the Honorable
               James Alger Fee, ruled on the basis of common law that the "carriers were each responsible
               for the acts and defaults of their own servants...and that 'tertiary' boycotts to
               isolate a single business from the facilities of commerce...(is) against the labor
               policy of the United States." As the carriers had consciously withheld their services
               from use by Wards, they were in violation of the law and, as such, "they should pay
               for the natural and probable consequences of having failed their duty."</div>  </a>

               Ward, and the reply brief of the defendants, the Northern Pacific Terminal Company
               of Oregon and other rail carriers as well as the opinion of Judge James Alger Fee,
               who was the chief judge of the District Court of the United States for the District
               of Oregon at the time of this filing. The suit filed by Montgomery Ward was an attempt
               to gain recompense for damages suffered during a strike and secondary boycott that
               began in December 1940. Judge Fee ruled in favor of the plaintiffs in June 1953.</div>  </a>
