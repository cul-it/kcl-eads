            <div class="para">The International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union was once one of the largest labor
               unions in the United States founded in 1900 by local union delegates representing
               about 2,000 members in cities in the northeastern United States. It was one of the
               first U.S. Unions to have a membership consisting of mostly females, and it played
               a key role in the labor history of the 1920s and 1930s. The union is generally referred
               to as the "ILGWU" or the "ILG". The ILGWU grew in geographical scope, membership size,
               and political influence to become one of the most powerful forces in American organized
               labor by mid-century. Representing workers in the women's garment industry, the ILGWU
               worked to improve working and living conditions of its members through collective
               bargaining agreements, training programs, health care facilities, cooperative housing,
               educational opportunities, and other efforts. The ILGWU merged with the Amalgamated
               Clothing and Textile Workers Union in 1995 to form the Union of Needle trades, Industrial
               and Textile Employees (UNITE). UNITE merged with the Hotel Employees and Restaurant
               Employees Union (HERE) in 2004 to create a new union known as UNITE HERE. The two
               unions that formed UNITE in 1995 represented only 250,000 workers between them, down
               from the ILGWU's peak membership of 450,000 in 1969.</div>  </a>

            <div class="para">Fabio Schettini was born in Brooklyn, New York on September 26, 1909. He earned his
               Bachelor of Science fron City College in 1943. Mr. Schettini joined ILGWU Local 48
               in May 1944, where his mother-in-law was already a member. He worked as a business
               agent, price adjuster, and union organizer for the ILGWU. Mr. Schettini participated
               in the Mirror Coat Strike in 1949 and organized for the ILGWU in Bensonhurst neighborhood
               in Brooklyn. </div>
            <div class="para"> According to his ILGWU autobiography (see Collection 5087/177, Box 2, Folder 30),
               he "learned [his] trade in Italy for four years and had [his] entire education in
               the evening schools of New York City. [He] was for 16 years a member of the Amalgamated
               Clothing Workers of America." </div>
            <div class="para"> In 1964, he ran for New York State Assembly as the Liberal Party candidate, loosing
               to Democrat Noah Goldstein. In 1965, he ran for New York City Council as a Liberal
               Party candidate and campaigned for Republican John Lindsay's mayoral campaign. </div>
            <div class="para"> Mr. Schettini was married to Antoinette Schettini. Together they had five children:
               Roland, Elaine, Linda, Nicholas, and Terry. His widow and children donated the materials
               in this collection.</div>  </a>

            <div class="para">Local 48 of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU), also known as
               the Italian Cloakmakers' Union, was chartered by members of Local 1 and Local 35 in
               1916 and based in New York, New York. As membership and industry declined in the 1970s,
               the local became Local 48 United Coat, Suit and Allied Garment Workers' Union of Brooklyn,
               Queens and Staten Island (coat and suit workers in all crafts in Brooklyn, Queens
               and Staten Island), and later Local 48 Coat, Suit, Dress, Rainwear and Allied Workers
               Union of North Brooklyn. In late 1981, the Joint Board approved a measure to dissolve
               Local 48, and Local 89 was renamed Local 89-48 to honor the historic significance
               of the Italian cloakmakers.</div>  </a>
