            <div class="para">The International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union was once one of the largest labor
               unions in the United States founded in 1900 by local union delegates representing
               about 2,000 members in cities in the northeastern United States. It was one of the
               first U.S. Unions to have a membership consisting of mostly females, and it played
               a key role in the labor history of the 1920s and 1930s. The union is generally referred
               to as the "ILGWU" or the "ILG". The ILGWU grew in geographical scope, membership size,
               and political influence to become one of the most powerful forces in American organized
               labor by mid-century. Representing workers in the women's garment industry, the ILGWU
               worked to improve working and living conditions of its members through collective
               bargaining agreements, training programs, health care facilities, cooperative housing,
               educational opportunities, and other efforts. The ILGWU merged with the Amalgamated
               Clothing and Textile Workers Union in 1995 to form the Union of Needle trades, Industrial
               and Textile Employees (UNITE). UNITE merged with the Hotel Employees and Restaurant
               Employees Union (HERE) in 2004 to create a new union known as UNITE HERE. The two
               unions that formed UNITE in 1995 represented only 250,000 workers between them, down
               from the ILGWU's peak membership of 450,000 in 1969.</div>  </a>

            <div class="para">The Education Department of Local 22 was developed to further the educational and
               cultural development of the Local's membership. It routinely sponsored lectures and
               courses on a variety of labor and other topics; it also offered musical and dramatic
               performances on a regular basis, either for or featuring its membership. </div>
            <div class="para"> Local 22 of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU), also known
               as the Dressmakers' Union, was chartered in December 1920 and based in New York City.
               The dress industry formed its own Joint Board in 1921 composed of Local 22 Dressmakers,
               Local 25 Waistmakers, Local 58 Waist Buttonhole Makers, Local 60 Waist and Dress Pressers,
               Local 66 Bonnaz Embroidery Workers, Local 89 Italian Waist and Dressmakers, and the
               waist and dress branch of Cutters' Local 10. A general work stoppage in February 1923
               in the dress industry won the union a 40 hour week and 10 percent wage increase, as
               well as a large gain of new members. During the summer of 1923, after years of discussion
               and deliberation, the two dress locals, Local 23 and 22 were consolidated. The dressmakers
               from Local 23 transferred to Local 22 and subsequently Local 22 joined the New York
               Cloakmakers' Joint Board. Soon, the Dress and Waist Joint Board became unnecessary
               and was dissolved. Local 25 Waistmakers were left without an affiliated organization
               and in October 1924 merged with the Dressmakers' Union, Local 22. </div>
            <div class="para"> By the end of 1926, the Communists had gained control of the dress organization in
               New York City and the union barely existed. In February 4, 1930, 25,000 dressmakers
               walked out of the shops. The strike was called to reorganize dressmakers and finally
               abolish the Communist influence in the industry. On April 8, 1930 the General Executive
               Board decided to separate the dressmakers from the Cloakmakers' Joint Board. In 1931,
               Charles Zimmerman formed a committee to rebuild Local 22. He was elected to executive
               board of Local 22 in 1932, and elected manager-secretary in 1933. Another walkout
               in all dress shops, both union and non-union on August 16, 1933 brought the dress
               industry to a halt. </div>
            <div class="para"> Zimmerman left Local 22 in 1958 to become manager of the Dress Joint Board. Israel
               Breslow succeeded him as manager of Local 22 from 1958 until his retirement in 1975.
               By 1975, the New York Dress Joint Board completed restructuring of affiliate locals,
               and Locals 60-60A, 159, and 38 were merged into existing Locals 22 and 89. Local 22
               gained jurisdiction over all dressmakers in Manhattan. In the 1980s, more locals were
               dissolved and members transferred to Local 22, but by 1984, Local 22 saw restructuring
               as well. Changes in the garment industry necessitated the dissolution of the Joint
               Board and Local 22 into the new Local 89-22-1.</div>  </a>

            <div class="para">The photographs in the collection were pulled from the records of the Local 22 Education
               Department (5780/057). The images illustrate the wide range of activities and programming
               put on by the department. Photographs show members taking classes, especially the
               women members. Classes depicted include music and literature. There are also dinners
               and banquets, meetings and conferences, speakers and lecterns and rallies. Additionally,
               there are portraits of officers and members, many with Charles Zimmerman (see also
