         <div class="item">This manuscript consists of approximately 110 type-written pages and represents the
            major portion of Mr. Pascoe's projected history of the United Mine Workers. The material
            here was written between 1926 and 1932. The manuscript deals mainly with Mr. Pascoe's
            early organizing activities in Kentucky and with the Illinois "rebellion" of the late
            twenties and early thirties. Mr. Pascoe's examination of the affair in Illinois differs
            from most other accounts in that he approaches the events from a "pro-international"
            point of view.</div>

            <div class="para">Samuel Pascoe was a United Mine Workers (UMW) organizer in Illinois, eastern Kentucky,
               and the anthracite region of northeastern Pennsylvania, and president of UMW District
               30 (Kentucky). </div>
            <div class="para"> A violent opponent of UMW District 12 leadership, Pascoe condemned District president
               Frank Farrington's association with the Peabody Coal Company, denounced his leadership
               and that of John H. Walker and generally applauded John L. Lewis' efforts to oust
               these officers and establish a provisional government for the District, claiming it
               had become dominated by communists. Pascoe alleged communist associations with Albert
               F. Coyle, editor of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers magazine. Pascoe also
               condemned the Brotherhood for its operation of non-union mines in West Virgina and
               Kentucky. </div>
            <div class="para"> The Jacksonville Agreement of 1924 was reviewed by Pascoe who claimed it was abrogated
               by most mine operators under the leadership of Charles Schwab of the Bethlehem Mines
               Corporation and Andrew Mellon of the Pittsburgh Coal Company. Pascoe also alleged
               collusion between the railroads and southern mine operators who opposed the agreement.
               Pascoe believed that southern mine owners attempted to "steal" Central Competitive
               Field markets and urged the necessity of organizing the southern miners. He insisted
               that the Interstate Commerce Commission had also established freight rates that unduly
               favored southern mines. </div>
            <div class="para"> He claimed to be instrumental in establishing District 30 (covering eastern Kentucky)
               in 1920 and served as its first president until his resignation in 1933. Throughout
               his career, Pascoe remained loyal to the union leadership and, especially during the
               anti-Lewis insurgency in District 12 in the late 1920's and early 1930's, fought union
               dissidence unswervingly. Pascoe retired in 1938 and died seven years later.</div>  </a>

            <div class="para">Reminiscences of Samuel Pascoe, United Mine Workers (UMW) organizer and president
               of UMW District 30 (Kentucky). Pascoe was a strong supporter of John L. Lewis and
               a vigorous critic of communist activities in the union. His memoirs center on his
               organizing efforts in Illinois and eastern Kentucky and his perception of union activities
               and politics in the Central Competitive Fields. </div>
            <div class="para"> Pascoe commented on and discussed the Bituminous Coal Strike of 1922, the Pittsburgh
               Coal Company Strike of 1925, the Anthracite Strike of 1925-1926, and the Harlan County
               Strike of 1931-1932. He also talked about government intervention in the industry,
               notably the attempts by secretary of labor James J. Davis to reconcile the UMW and
               the mine owners in 1927 and the Senate investigations into the condition of the coal
               fields of Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Ohio in the following year. Pascoe also
               commented on the impact of the Norris-La Gaurdia Act of 1932 and the Davis-Kelly Bill
               of that year.</div>  </a>
