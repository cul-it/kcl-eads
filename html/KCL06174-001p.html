            <div class="para">New York State United Teachers (NYSUT) was created in 1972 by the merger of the New
               York State Teachers Association (NYSTA) and the United Teachers of New York (UTNY).
               NYSTA had been affiliated with the National Education Association (NEA), and UTNY
               with the American Federation of Teachers (AFT). UTNY was the statewide organization
               whose United Federation of Teachers (UFT), led by Albert Shanker, was the predominant
               teachers' union in New York City. In joining with United Teachers and affiliating
               with the AFT, NYSUT also became a member union of the AFL-CIO. </div>
            <div class="para"> In 1976, NYSUT voted to disaffiliate with the NEA. Some locals left NYSUT and created
               the NYEA (New York Educators Association), which became the state affiliate for the
               NEA. In the early 1980s, NYEA changed its name to NEA-NY. </div>
            <div class="para"> NYEA/NEA- NY viewed association with the AFL-CIO's industrial unions as undermining
               the professional image and independence of teachers. The two organizations also differed
               strongly on aspects of the governance structure, particularly with respect to ethnic
               minority representation, with NYSUT opposed to mandatory minimums. The rivalry between
               NYSUT and NYEA/NEA-NY in organizing new locals expended a great deal of resources
               for both labor organizations. </div>
            <div class="para"> While competition with NYEA/NEA-NY was a constant focus of NYSUT's organizing efforts
               for teachers, NYSUT was also organizing college faculty members, nurses, and other
               non-teaching personnel. Once members were organized, NYSUT continued to advocate for
               teachers' and other workers' rights through contract support and legal services at
               the local level and political involvement at the state and federal levels, supporting
               candidates and legislation that protected funding, due process, and working conditions.
               </div>
            <div class="para"> NEA-N Y merged with NYSUT in 2006, by which time NYSUT had grown to more than half
               a million members, becoming the largest union in New York State.</div>  </a>

            <p></p>
            
            <div class="para">Thomas Y. Hobart, Jr., served as President of NYSUT since it was created in 1973 from
               the merger of NYSTA (New York State Teacher's Association, founded in 1845 and the
               largest state affiliate of the National Education Association) and UTNY (United Teachers
               of New York, affiliated with American Federation of Teachers-AFL-CIO). Hobart was
               a prime mover in the disaffiliation of NYSUT from the NEA, and reaffirmation of affiliation
               with the AFT, in 1976. He was involved in jurisdictional disputes that followed the
               split for many years, as NYSUT and NEA (through its affiliate, New York Educators
               Association) fought for membership at the local level; the rivalry was finally resolved
               when the two again merged in 2006, still maintaining strong ties with the AFT. </div>
            <div class="para">  The president serves as a vice president of the AFT and vice president of New York
               State AFL-CIO and represents NYSUT in high-level interactions with state elected and
               appointed officials, particularly the Department of Education; international labor
               organizations; political parties; nonprofit service organizations such as the New
               York Special Olympics; and other unions. The president or his assistant has often
               visited regional offices to maintain firsthand contact with local concerns. </div>
            <div class="para"> Hobart retired in 2005 and was succeeded by NYSUT's current president, Richard Ianuzzi.</div>  </a>
