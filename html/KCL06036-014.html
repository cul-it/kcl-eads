            <div class="para">Founded in 1900 by local union delegates representing about 2,000 members in cities
               in the northeastern United States, the ILGWU grew in geographical scope, membership
               size, political influence to become one of the most powerful forces in American organized
               labor by mid-century. Representing workers in the women's garment industry, the ILGWU
               worked to improve working and living conditions of its members through collective
               bargaining agreements, training programs, health care facilities, cooperative housing,
               educational opportunities, and other efforts. In 1995, the ILGWU merged with the Amalgamated
               Clothing and Textile Workers Union (ACTWU) to form the Union of Needletrades, Industrial
               and Textile Employees (UNITE).</div>  </a>

            <div class="para">Vanni B. Montana (Giovanni Buscemi) was born February 12, 1902 in Mazara del Vallo
               in southwestern Sicily. As a socialist in a growing fascist state, Montana fled his
               native land as a political refugee finding himself first in Vienna, before heading
               to Berlin and settling in Paris. On his travels, Montana came in contact and befriended
               other Italian anti-fascists and socialists. During his time in France, he took classes,
               worked with Italian immigrants, and he helped organize and unionize laborers, diggers,
               and restaurant workers, arranging strikes and giving speeches. On July 4, 1928, Montana
               immigrated to the United States and soon found himself surrounded by the Italian-American
               community and antifascists, becoming employed by the newspapers "Il Lavoratore" and
               "Il Nuovo Mondo" (later "La Stampa Libera"). He became involved in the Italian socialist
               movement, organizing rallies against fascism and urging opposition against Mussolini.
               After the war, Montana was active in the rebuilding of a democratic Italy, and organized
               one of the first people to people tourism programs to bring Italian immigrants and
               their American born children to the country. </div>
            <div class="para"> Montana was a co-founder of the Italian-American Labor Council in 1941, and helped
               draft the petition to exempt Italian citizens living in the United States from the
               "enemy aliens" category. For thirty-four years, he was an editor of "Giustizia," the
               Italian publication of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union, as well as
               the Education Director of ILGWU Local 89 and worked on the "Voice of Local 89" radio
               program. Montana died in 1991 at the age of 89.</div>  </a>

            <div class="para">The collection contains the typed manuscript for Vanni B. Montana's autobiography,
               "The Shambles: Broken Bridges over the Seas," from 1977. The "Shambles" is the English
               version of his Italian language autobiography "Amarostico" which is currently available
               at over a dozen public and academic libraries. Montana interweaves historical events
               in his hometown of Mazara del Vallo and Sicily with episodes from his youth, illustrating
               how the political climate and early experiences would influence him later in life.
               The first section recounts not just life in Sicily, but topics such as socialism,
               antifascism, communism, and the individuals Montana met as a student and the thoughts
               and ideas debated among his circle. As fascism grew, Montana found it difficult to
               remain in his home and country and details his experiences escaping and becoming a
               political refugee. After immigrating to the U.S., he found himself surrounded by like-minded
               individuals and aligned himself with the Italian-American community. He discusses
               his various jobs and organizations he was involved with, including his work with the
               ILGWU and Local 89, the founding of the Italian-American Labor Council, and his trips
               to Italy after the war. Montana's manuscript reflects his interest and activities
               as an Italian-American labor leader and socialist. Researchers may be interested in
               the organizations discussed including: the Italian Socialist Party (PSI), the Socialist
               Party of Italian Workers (PSLI), the Italian Socialist Federation of the American
               Socialist Party, the Mazzini Society, the Italian-American Victory Council, the Italian-American
               Labor Council, the Office of War Information (OWI), the Amalgamated Clothing Workers
               Of America (ACWA) and the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU). Notable
               individuals mentioned in Montana's manuscript include: Carlo Tresca, Sidney Hillman,
               Luigi Antonini, Generoso Pope, Augusto Bellanca, Giuseppe Modigliani and Ignazio Silone.
               The Vanni Buscemi Montana Collection located at the George Meany Archives contains
               correspondence, writings and clippings that Montana amassed to write his autobiography.</div>  </a>
