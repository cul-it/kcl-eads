            <div class="para">Serving during World War II as an active member of the National War Labor Board, "trouble
               shooter" Edwin E. Witte had been studying labor disputes for the past thirty-two years.
               Professor of economics at the University, of Wisconsin from 1933, Witte was frequently
               called upon to leave the classroom to solve practical problems, such as steering the
               formulation of the Social Security Act of 1935, and later, serving as chairman of
               the fact-finding board appointed to settle the packing-house workers' strike in 1946.
               </div>
            <div class="para"> A native of Jefferson County, Wisconsin, Edwin Emil Witte was born January 4, 1887,
               the son of Emil and Anna (Yaeck) Witte. The farm boy "early formed the ambition to
               become a distinguished scholar," and upon his graduation from the Watertown High School
               entered the University of Wisconsin in 1905. He received the B.A. degree in 1909,
               winning as well membership in Phi Beta Kappa, Delta Sigma Rho, and Artus (an honorary
               scholastic ecomonics fraternity), and immediately began his graduate work. In June
               1912 he interrupted his studies to assume the position of senior statistician to the
               Wisconsin Industrial Commission. Shortly afterward young Witte became secretary to
               Congressman John M. Nelson, and in 1914 special investigator of the United States
               Commission on Industrial Relations. The following year he returned to the university
               as instructor, and completed the work toward his doctorate in 1916. The Wisconsin
               Industrial Commission again called for his . Services, and from 1917 to 1922 he served
               on its staff as secretary. It was in 1920 that he began part-time lecturing on economics
               and related social sciences at the alma mater. </div>
            <div class="para"> Although lacking the technical training of the librarian, in 1922 Witte was placed
               in charge of the Wisconsin Legislative Reference Library, the pioneer in the field
               of legislative reference. He remained there for eleven years. During this period he
               served as secretary of the Wisconsin Committee on a Retirement System for State Employees
               (1929-31); and he began the writing of his numerous articles for legal and other periodicals,
               mainly on the subjects of trade union law, </div>
            <div class="para"> social insurance, and labor legislation. In 1932 his treatise The Government in Labor
               Disputes appeared; said to be the first book which covered the entire field, it dealt
               with every aspect of Governmental intervention in labor disputes and the social economic,
               and legal phases of industrial troubles. It was during his librarian ship, too, that
               Witte made an intensive study of the use and effect of injunctions in labor disputes.
               This report was in part responsible for the passage of the Norris-La Guardia Anti-Injunction
               Act in 1932, which ruled that "yellow-dog" contracts were not enforceable in the Federal
               courts and limited the power of those courts to issue injunctions in labor disputes.
               </div>
            <div class="para"> Then, while a member of the Wisconsin Interim Commission on Taxation (1933-34), the
               economist was appointed full professor at the university to teach courses not only
               in economics, but in political science, sociology, and lav. His favorite subject was
               the relations of Government to business. Although Witte preferred to teach, he liked
               to feel, that he had a "part in solving practical problems and shaping practical developments."
               Thus time and again he had left the university and served the Government as mediator
               and arbitrator, administrator, and member of a considerable number of advisory and
               policy-making boards. "In finding workable solutions of labor difficulties and in
               advising and assisting public officials with concrete problems in my field of competence,"
               Witte had written, "I am interested above all else in trying to help employers and
               employees to get along with each other in this day and age of organization and collective
               bargaining and to minimize the conflicts between Government and business." </div>
            <div class="para"> Witte considered his most important work his part in the formulation of the Federal
               Social Security Act of 1935, of which he is often called the author. After more than
               . Twenty years had elapsed since the first proposal for compulsory unemployment insurance
               had been made, on June 29, 1934, President Roosevelt created the Committee on Economic
               Security to study and report to him on methods of carrying out the Administration's
               plans for "the security of the men, women and children of the nation." Witte was named
               secretary and executive director of the committee, of which other members were Secretary
               of Labor Perkins, Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau, Attorney-General Cummings,
               Secretary of Agriculture Wallace, and Federal Emergency Belief Administrator Hopkins.
               The following January, President Roosevelt forwarded the </div>
            <div class="para"> committee's full report to Congress, which on August 14, </div>
            <div class="para"> 1935, finally passed a bill known as the Social Security </div>
            <div class="para"> Act of 1935, to provide for old-age insurance and unemployment compensation, as well
               as health, welfare, and rehabilitation service to the States. </div>
            <div class="para"> The economist's next Washington posts were as staff member of the President's Committee
               on Administration Management (1936-37), and then as member of the United States Social
               Security Advisory Council (1937-38). Witte was meanwhile serving in his home state
               on the Wisconsin State Planning Board (1935-38), the Wisconsin Citizens' Committee
               on Public Welfare (1936-37), and on the Wisconsin labor Relations Board (1937-39).
               In addition to these activities and his teaching duties, Witte completed the writing
               of The Preparation of Proposed Legislative Measures by Administrative Department,
               (1937). </div>
            <div class="para"> In 1941 Witte accepted membership on the Federal Advisory Council for Unemployment
               Security and also became special agent of the National Defence Mediation Board. The
               National War Labor Board named the Professor chairman of the Regional War Labor Board
               for Detroit in January 1943. The knotty problems of the biggest war plants in the
               nation came under Witte's jurisdiction here, until his appointment as public member
               of the National War Labor Board (1944-45). In January 1946 Witte was appointed by
               Labor Secretary Schwellenback to head a three-man fact-finding panel to hasten settlement
               of the dispute of the two hundred and fifty thousand striking employees of the meat-
               packing companies, during which the nation's output was reduced about 75 per cent.
               Calling the industry "a low-wage industry in which the straight-time hourly wage rates
               are substantially below the average for all manufacturing industries," the Board on
               February 7 recommended a l6-cent hourly increase for the workers. Back at the Wisconsin
               University, after devoting the war years to the adjustment of labor disputes, Witte
               in 1946 was working on a comprehensive history of social security in the United States,
               as well as on textbooks on social insurance and on the relations of Government and
               business. </div>
            <div class="para"> The specialist in labor relation was a member of the Council of the American Economics
               Association, the Council of the American Association </div>
            <div class="para"> for Labor Legislation, and of the American Association for Social Security. In September
               19l6 Witte was married to Florence E. Rimsnider; the couple had a son and two daughters.
               He listed his religion as Methodist, and his favorite hobby as gardening. Witte gave
               the credit for his concepts in the labor field to his college teachers and to the
               contacts and experiences of his government assignments. He belonged to no political
               party and seldom cast a straight party vote: "I have had appointments from politicians
               of all political faiths and have gotten along well with them," he said of himself.
               "In my entire life I have never been an applicant for any Job and have turned down
               most of the Jobs offered me. I am a hard-working man, but not a flashy or brilliant
               fellow."</div>  </a>
