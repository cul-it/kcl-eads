            <div class="para">Nicola Sacco (April 22, 1891 August 23, 1927) and Bartolomeo Vanzetti (June 11, 1888
               August 23, 1927) were Italian-born anarchists who were convicted of murdering two
               men during the armed robbery of a shoe factory in Braintree, Massachusetts, United
               States in 1920. </div>
            <div class="para"> A controversial trial in 1921 resulted in the men's conviction, despite equivocal
               ballistics evidence and numerous witnesses who claimed Sacco had been in Boston's
               North End and Vanzetti in Plymouth, Massachusetts on the day of the robbery. Both
               defendants had to recount their anarchist beliefs in court to explain why they had
               been found armed when arrested, leading to suspicions that this may have prejudiced
               the jury. </div>
            <div class="para"> After a few hours' deliberation, the jury found Sacco and Vanzetti guilty of first-degree
               murder on July 14, 1921. A series of appeals followed, funded largely by a private
               Sacco and Vanzetti Defense Committee. The appeals were based on recanted testimony,
               conflicting ballistics evidence, a prejudicial pre-trial statement by the jury foreman,
               and a confession by an alleged participant in the robbery. All appeals were denied
               by the original trial judge and eventually by the Massachusetts State Supreme Court.
               By 1925, the case had drawn worldwide attention. As details of the trial and the men's
               suspected innocence became known, Sacco and Vanzetti became the center of one of the
               largest causes clbres in modern history. In 1927, protests on their behalf were held
               in every major city in North America and Europe, as well as Tokyo, Sydney, So Paulo,
               Rio de Janeiro, Buenos Aires, and Johannesburg. </div>
            <div class="para"> Celebrated writers, artists, and academics pleaded for their pardon or for a new
               trial. Harvard law professor and future Supreme Court justice Felix Frankfurter argued
               for their innocence in a widely read Atlantic Monthly article that was later published
               in book form. Sacco and Vanzetti were sentenced to death in April 1927, accelerating
               the outcry. Responding to a massive influx of telegrams urging their pardon, Massachusetts
               governor Alvan Fuller appointed a three-man commission to investigate the case. After
               weeks of secret deliberation, which included interviews with the judge, lawyers, and
               several witnesses, the commission upheld the verdict. Sacco and Vanzetti were executed
               via electric chair on August 23, 1927. Subsequent riots destroyed property in Paris,
               London, and other cities. </div>
            <div class="para"> Since their deaths, some critics have concluded that the two men were convicted largely
               because of anti-Italian prejudice and their anarchist political beliefs and were therefore
               unjustly executed. Investigations of the case continued throughout the 1930s and 1940s.
               The publication of the men's letters, containing eloquent professions of innocence,
               intensified belief in their wrongful execution. Additional ballistics tests and incriminating
               statements by the men's acquaintances have clouded the case. In 1977, Massachusetts
               Governor Michael Dukakis issued a proclamation that Sacco and Vanzetti had been unfairly
               tried and convicted and that "any disgrace should be forever removed from their names",
               but did not proclaim them innocent.</div>  </a>
