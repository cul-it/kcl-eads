            <div class="para">The International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union was once one of the largest labor
               unions in the United States founded in 1900 by local union delegates representing
               about 2,000 members in cities in the northeastern United States. It was one of the
               first U.S. Unions to have a membership consisting of mostly females, and it played
               a key role in the labor history of the 1920s and 1930s. The union is generally referred
               to as the "ILGWU" or the "ILG". The ILGWU grew in geographical scope, membership size,
               and political influence to become one of the most powerful forces in American organized
               labor by mid-century. Representing workers in the women's garment industry, the ILGWU
               worked to improve working and living conditions of its members through collective
               bargaining agreements, training programs, health care facilities, cooperative housing,
               educational opportunities, and other efforts. The ILGWU merged with the Amalgamated
               Clothing and Textile Workers Union in 1995 to form the Union of Needle trades, Industrial
               and Textile Employees (UNITE). UNITE merged with the Hotel Employees and Restaurant
               Employees Union (HERE) in 2004 to create a new union known as UNITE HERE. The two
               unions that formed UNITE in 1995 represented only 250,000 workers between them, down
               from the ILGWU's peak membership of 450,000 in 1969.</div>  </a>

            <div class="para">Cleveland had a garment industry very early on, in fact, a Cloak Pressers' Protective
               Union was formed in 1899, before the founding of the ILGWU. The early Cleveland Joint
               Board consisted of Cloak and Suit Tailors 26, Skirt and Dress Makers 27, Women Garment
               Makers 29, Ladies' Garment Pressers 37, Ladies' Garment Cutters 42, Sample and Ladies
               Tailors 94. </div>
            <div class="para"> Strikes and low membership decimated the union in Cleveland from the strike of 1911
               until the near closure of the Joint Board in 1916. The union had a difficult time
               gaining a position in the cloak and suit trade of the city. By the summer of 1917,
               membership in the Joint Board had risen significantly and in 1918, the union and the
               Joint Board submitted demands to the Cleveland Garment Manufacturers' Association
               for a wage increase. After a strike, a Board of Referees was established to hear the
               controversy and render decisions. Relations between manufacturers and the Joint Board
               were strained, but in 1919, a collective agreement was signed by the manufacturers'
               associations and the Cleveland Joint Board finally and firmly establishing the union
               in Cleveland after a decade of struggle. During this time, Charles Kreindler was the
               manager of the Joint Board. </div>
            <div class="para"> In the 1920s, Cleveland was one of the only large cities that did not subscribe to
               a 44 hour week and week-work in the garment industry. Instead, the shops that manufactured
               medium priced garments utilized the section system, which required less skilled labor
               and posed a challenge for the Cleveland cloakmakers. An investigation by Cleveland
               Joint Board and the Cloak Manufacturers' Association established standards of production.
               In 1932, there was the Cleveland Cloak and Dress Strike. Hearings were conducted in
               1938 before an impartial chairman to eliminate differences between the New York and
               Cleveland Cloak markets. By 1944, the Joint Board had established vacations with pay
               for all garment workers in the market, as well as adding a health plan with medical
               care, sick benefits and life insurance. The Joint Board was comprised of Locals 26,
               27, 29, 37, 42, 44, 52, 207, 209, 211, 300, 358, and 368. The Joint Board and Ohio
               district were headed by Abraham Katovsky, who had been a business agent under Kreindler,
               and helmed the Cleveland Joint Board until his death in 1945. He was succeeded by
               Nathan Solomon as the new manager. Solomon had been serving as the secretary treasurer
               for many years. Approximately 1,000 knitgood workers in Cleveland were organized into
               four locals comprising the Cleveland Knitgoods Council. This Council was supervised
               by the head of the Cleveland Joint Board. During the early 1950s, Louis Friend managed
               the Joint Board, and Nicholas Kirtzman was the director of the Cleveland and Ohio-Kentucky
               Region. </div>
            <div class="para"> A new headquarters for the Cleveland ILGWU Health Center and Ohio-Kentucky regional
               headquarters was dedicated in 1951. David Solomon manager of the Joint Board for many
               years after Friend, retired April 1956, and the organizer of the Joint Board, Julius
               Guralnik, took over duties as manager of the Cleveland Joint Board. From 1959 into
               the 1960s, with the Cleveland cloak market declining into insignificance, a shift
               in the Ohio-Kentucky Region took place from an emphasis on the cloak industry towards
               sportswear, knitgoods, and dresses. The Cleveland Knitgoods Council made significant
               membership gains. By 1962, Kirtzman became director and manager of the Joint Board,
               with Edward Milano the assistant director, and the steady decline in membership in
               Cleveland within the shrinking cloak and dress industry began to stabilize. </div>
            <div class="para"> Kirtzman, an ILGWU vice-president and regional director since 1950, died in March
               1963. Sam Janis, who was previously an assistant general manager of the Eastern Region,
               succeeded Kirtzman as the new Ohio-Kentucky Region director and was also elected manager
               of the Cleveland Joint Board. In 1968, Janis and the Joint Board were involved in
               the successful campaign for Carl Stokes election as mayor of Cleveland. Stokes was
               the first African American mayor of a large U.S. city, and Manager Janis was appointed
               to the mayor's commission as a labor representative to study the welfare crisis in
               the city. During the 1970s, the Joint Board was involved in community and political
               activities, including submitting a proposal to ease procedures for voter registration.
               </div>
            <div class="para"> In 1978, there was a realignment of the Ohio-Kentucky Region and all Ohio locals
               became part of the Northeast and Western Pennsylvania Department, renamed the Northeast,
               Western Pennsylvania and Ohio Department. Sam Janis retired in May 1978 and Al Gargiulo,
               who had been the assistant regional director, became the manager of the Cleveland
               Joint Board, as well as the Knitgoods Council and the Ohio District.</div>  </a>

            <div class="para">The collection predominantly consists of the Cleveland Garment Industry Arbitration
               in 1919. The records contain transcripts of the hearings between the Cleveland Locals
               and the Cleveland Cloak, Suit, Skirt and Dress Manufacturers' Association. Manufacturers
               wanted a reduction in wages. The records begin in 1918, and by 1921 advances in the
               industry included the establishment of a standard wage scale affecting all shops and
               classes of workers, as well as an adopted standard of production. Also contained in
               the files are the award summary, memorandum, arbitration, back pay, wage adjustment,
               and wage comparisons. The hearings between union and manufacturers include exhibits
               showing increases in living, inflation, and wages and industry reports and wage studies
               for the Cleveland area. </div>
