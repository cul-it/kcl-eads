            <div class="para">Mr. William C. Rogers was appointed by the Commissioner of Labor to investigate the
               strike on the Yonkers Railroad Company, the street car system for the city of Yonkers.
               Serving with him were Mr. M. J. Reagan and Mr. James McManus. The Board held hearings
               in Yonkers on January 10, 11, 1913. </div>
            <div class="para"> The Yonkers Railroad Company had been in the hands of a receiver for five years,
               and during the time of the receivership the employees had been unable to secure a
               written contract since the court had said that the receiver did not have the power
               to sign such a contract. During this period, however, the receiver had agreed to abide
               by the contract verbally and had done so. One feature of the agreement was that only
               Yonkers men would be hired, and this was perpetuated in a city ordinance which required
               a new man to have 15 hours of instruction before he could take a car out alone. </div>
            <div class="para"> In January of 1913 the president of the reorganized company sent a man to the Yonkers
               Railroad with instructions to the superintendent that he be hired. The superintendent
               asked that certain men instruct the new man, and when they refused he fired them.
               The union upheld the men and workers walked off the job saying that management had
               repudiated the contract. However, no written contract had been signed since the president
               refused when it had been presented to him earlier in 1912.</div>  </a>
