            <div class="para">Arlon Everett "Art" Lyon was born in Thedford, Nebraska on October 15, 1899. In 1919,
               after his discharge from the U.S. Army, Mr. Lyon secured a job with the Southern Pacific
               Railroad in Stockton, California as a signal helper. After a few years of employment,
               Mr. Lyon became active in his local union, the Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen [BRS],
               first as member of the local grievance committee, then as chairman of that committee.
               Within a year, Mr. Lyon became general chairman for the local BRS on the Southern
               Pacific; this was a full time position. </div>
            <div class="para"> His rise through the BRS ranks continued, becoming a member of the Grand Executive
               Board of the national union and finally accepting a job at the international headquarters
               of the BRS in Chicago, Illinois. Mr. Lyon worked as the assistant to both the union
               president and the union secretary-treasurer; he also served as the editor of The Signalman's
               Journal, the publication of the BRS. </div>
            <div class="para"> In 1934, Mr. Lyon became president of the BRS after being recommended by the outgoing
               union president. Mr. Lyon served as union president from 1934-1945. In 1945, Mr. Lyon
               became the Executive Secretary of the Railway Labor Executives' Board [RLEA]. He held
               this position until 1962, serving as the spokesman for all of the member organizations
               of the RLEA in Washington, D.C. </div>
            <div class="para"> From 1945 to 1962, while serving as Executive Secretary of the RLEA in Washington,
               Mr. Lyon was assigned the task of representing American railway labor on the Executive
               Committee of the International Transport Workers' Federation [ITWF]. This was part
               of the RLEA's broader responsibilities in the Marshall Plan during the post-war period.
               During this phase of the Marshall Plan, he was one of three labor members of the Public
               Advisory Board of the Economic Cooperation Administration. He also served on the Department
               of Labor's Trade Union Advisory Committee on International Labor Affairs. Mr. Lyon
               was the only labor member of the U.S. National Commission for the Pan-American Railway
               Congress. He was delegate to sessions of the Inland Transport Committee of the International
               Labor Organization. </div>
            <div class="para"> In 1962, Mr. Lyon left the RLEA and accepted the appointment as the labor member
               on the Railroad Retirement Board from President John F. Kennedy. He was reappointed
               to the board by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964. </div>
            <div class="para"> After his retirement, Mr. Lyon spent his time writing about the history of the BRS,
               American railway labor, and his involvement in both.</div>  </a>

            <div class="para"> This collection contains a selection of writings by A. E. Lyon, president emeritus
               of the Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen and executive secretary of the Railway Labor
               Executives' Association [RLEA]. The topics of the manuscripts contained in this collection,
               and its associated collection 5450 mf, cover a broad range of topics about the American
               railroad labor movement and railroading itself. In this collection, the topics covered
               include an analysis of government relations with regard to railroad labor relations
               from 1920 to 1974; a history of the successful campaign to create legislation that
               would standardize and regulate railway signaling devices and systems; an essay about
               James P. Mitchell, secretary of labor under President Eisenhower; and, a memoir that
               A. E. Lyon refers to as "a series of memoirs and historical sketches, a combination
               of autobiographical material and my version of events in the history of the Brotherhood
               of Railroad Signalmen" (from the Preface to vol. 1). </div>
            <div class="para"> These manuscripts provide both historical narratives surrounding major pieces of
               railroad legislation, railroad labor history, and railroad history as well as offering
               the personal insights and opinions of A. E. Lyon, who was at the center of American
               railroad labor organizations for more than half a century.</div>  </a>
