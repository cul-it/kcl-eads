            <div class="para">The Board of Arbitration was established following an agreement between the parties
               September 28, 1962, made pursuant to a request of the President of the United States
               that the strike in progress on the lines of the carrier be terminated and the remaining
               issues be submitted to arbitration. </div>
            <div class="para"> Members of the Board included B. W. Heineman, representing the carrier; G. E. Leighty,
               representing the organization; upon nomination by President Kennedy, Sylvester Garrett
               was designated by the National Mediation Board as the third and neutral member of
               the Board. </div>
            <div class="para"> Hearings commenced October 2, 1962, in Washington, D.C., and were concluded October
               4. The award was rendered October 8, 1962. </div>
            <div class="para"> This proceeding developed out of the handling of a notice served by the organization
               on the carrier for a rule that: "no position in existence on December 3, 1957, will
               be abolished or discontinued except by agreement between the carrier and the organization."
               </div>
            <div class="para"> The customary procedures of direct negotiation, mediation and emergency board recommendations
               were exhausted without agreement. A work stoppage occurred. In settlement of the dispute
               the parties agreed upon a program of employee protection as recommended by Emergency
               Board No. 147 except for four areas of disagreement which were submitted to this Arbitration
               Board for resolution at the request of the President. In submitting the questions
               at issue for settlement, the parties stated: </div>
            <div class="para"> "It is agreed that each question shall be resolved and decided by the panel on the
               basis of and in terms of its determination of the proper application to the question
               of the Report and Recommendations of Emergency Board No. 147, dated June 14, 1962."
               </div>
            <div class="para"> The four specific questions and the decisions of the Board follow. The representative
               of the organization indicated a dissent in the decision in response to questions two,
               three, and four. </div>
            <div class="para"> 1. What shall be established as a substantial period of advance notice to be given
               by the Carrier to the Union of a decision to permanently discontinue any position?
               </div>
            <div class="para"> 2. What procedures should be followed when the Carrier and the Union do not agree
               on whether a position should be abolished? </div>
            <div class="para"> 3. The U. S. Emergency Board No. 147 recommended a forty-hour workweek guarantee
               for extra board employees. Should the Union or the Carrier decide on the size of the
               extra board? </div>
            <div class="para"> 4. Should the Union be allowed to pursue claims against the Carrier which resulted
               from jobs abolished before the current agreement was made?</div>  </a>
