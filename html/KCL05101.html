            <div class="para">Pursuant to Section 141 of the State Labor Law of the State of New York, a State Board
               of Mediation and Arbitration was appointed to investigate the lockout of employees
               of the two Syracuse Plants of the Crucible Steel Company. Hearings were begun on June
               17, 1913 before a Board composed of the following men: William C. Rogers, Chairman;
               P.J. Downey; and James McManus. </div>
            <div class="para"> About the first of April, 1913 approximately 1,000 of the 1,500 employees of the
               two Syracuse plants joined together to discuss the formation of a union. On May 10,
               1913 a notice was posted by the employer in all of the departments stating that the
               two Syracuse plants would be closed indefinitely. The notice further stated that any
               employee who wished to remain at work could do so by signing a statement that he was
               not a member of the union. The obvious intent of the company was to break the union
               through a lockout of union members. At the time of the hearings, over 900 men were
               still out of work. </div>
            <div class="para"> The union was formed to improve the wages and working conditions of all employees
               at the two plants. For the most part, wages had not risen for 20 years. The physical
               working conditions were bad, and the men often had to pay for their tools, and equipment
               under the sub-contracting system which existed in some parts of the plants. The employees
               wanted to establish a departmental shop committee system, which would allow them to
               present their grievances and demands as a group, rather than as individuals. The employees
               did not ask for company recognition of the union, they asked only for recognition
               of the shop committee. </div>
            <div class="para">  The company refused, as a matter of policy, to allow its employees to organize a
               union. The company stated that it would not consider dealing with shop committees
               unless the employees returned to the plants as non-union employees. Upon satisfaction
               of that condition, the company stated, the question of shop committees would be considered.</div>  </a>
