            <div class="para">The foundation for this proceedings was to be found in a so-called moratorium provision
               in the agreements signed by the parties in 1951 and 1952. The moratoruim provided
               for wage adjustments when the wage stabilization policy permitted so-called annual
               improvement wage increases. A referee was to be appointed by the President if the
               parties were unable to agree that a wage increase was justified. The President appointed
               Paul N. Guthrie as referee on December 1, 1952. The referee decided that this proceeding
               had power to determine only three issues. First, whether further wage increases were
               justified; second, If so, what such increases should be; and third, the effective
               date thereof. Hearings were held and voluminous data accumulated according to the
               report, but this collection contains only the printed items listed below.</div>  </a>
