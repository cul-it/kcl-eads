            <div class="para">Theodore Woodrow Kheel was said to be named for both Woodrow Wilson and his political
               rival Theodore Roosevelt, the result of a compromise between his politically differing
               parents. The settlement presaged a career in which Kheel would be tapped by mayors,
               governors, and presidents to settle disputes that were part of the nation's major
               political and social transitions from post-World War II to well into the 21st century.
               </div>
            <div class="para"> Born in 1914 in Brooklyn, Ted Kheel attended public high school in the Bronx. He
               was awarded a Regents scholarship to Cornell University, where he attended an accelerated
               undergraduate law school program permitting him to earn a bachelor's and law degree
               in six years. </div>
            <div class="para"> In private practice for a brief time after graduation from law school, Kheel soon
               was offered a position as a National Labor Relations Board attorney in Washington.
               Kheel's special talents as a mediator and his obvious political skills soon gave him
               the opportunity to move to a new war-time agency, where he was initially hired as
               principal mediation officer. By 1944, he had been appointed executive director of
               the National War Labor Board, with a staff of 2,500 who were hearing 150 disputes
               a week. Kheel's work at the WLB introduced him to the most important figures in the
               labor movement and key government officialscontacts he would use effectively in the
               future. </div>
            <div class="para"> Following the end of World War II, Kheel returned to New York City and was drafted
               by Mayor O'Dywer to serve in the city's new Labor Relations Division, which Kheel
               came to head within a year. With the agreement of the mayor, Kheel was able to serve
               both in this position and maintain a separate, private law practice. </div>
            <div class="para"> In 1949, Kheel was appointed to a part-time position as impartial chairman for an
               important segment of public transit in New York City, a position in which he would
               render 30,000 decisions through 1982. Also in 1949, Kheel became a partner in the
               New York law firm Battle, Fowler, Jaffin and Kheel. His skills in conflict resolution
               led an observer to remark that the firm's work began with a battle, ended by Kheel.
               </div>
            <div class="para"> During his more than half a century of involvement in labor matters, Kheel was known
               above all else for his extraordinary ability to get feuding parties to make concessions
               to reach an agreement. In the important New York and national labor disputes which
               he would be called to mediate, Kheel's approach was to protect management rights and
               at the same time demand fairness to workers while also trying to protect the public
               interest in the issue. </div>
            <div class="para"> Kheel's was frequently the voice of reason in settling a number of extremely difficult
               labor disputes of the 1960s and 1970s. Mayor Robert F. Wagner, Jr., turned to Kheel
               to help end the 114-day newspaper strike of 1962-63. Among his most infamous cases
               was the strike involving Mike Quill, head of the Transport Workers Union, who publically
               battled Mayor John V. Lindsay in 1965-66. Kheel's efforts also included helping coordinate
               bargainers and mediators during the 35-day New York City teachers' strike in 1968.
               President Lyndon B. Johnson summoned Kheel to Washington in 1964 to help mediate 10
               days of feverish negotiations that prevented a nationwide rail walkout. Kheel would
               ultimately serve as a mediator and advisor for virtually every New York mayor from
               O'Dwyer to Beame, for the Kennedy-Johnson Administration, and other presidential administrations
               as well. </div>
            <div class="para"> Kheel's interests in public issues were not limited to the labor sector. The policy
               disputes that came to his attention as a mediator and lawyer frequently cried out
               for larger solutions, and Kheel was not averse to using his considerable public presence
               and media contacts to seek redress, especially for what he viewed as past institutional
               injustices or misguided government actions. Although pressed to do so on a number
               of occasions, Kheel refused to run for elective office, preferring the role of a labor
               neutral and public advocate. </div>
            <div class="para"> Kheel was also not averse to backing his powers of persuasion with legal action:
               a fierce advocate for public transit, he initiated a class action lawsuit over the
               Port Authority of New York and New Jersey's refusal to fund mass rail transit. His
               most sustained crusade for the public good related to his battle to limit commuter
               auto traffic and control highway building in New York City in favor of increased use
               of public transportation. Initially attacked by Port Authority officials and some
               city, state, and federal politicians of both parties, many of the solutions originally
               proposed by Kheel, including the concept of the subsidized fare, became public policy
               in later years. </div>
            <div class="para"> An early supporter of the civil rights movement, Kheel and his wife Ann become involved
               with the New York Urban League in the 1950s. He served as its president in 1955 and
               as national president for four years. He worked with President Johnson on race issues
               and with Martin Luther King, Jr., in a libel suit against the New York Times. Kheel's
               mediation skills led to important strides in hiring African Americans in the airline
               industry. His reputation for sensitivity to minority issues resulted in his becoming
               involved in efforts to add civilians to the New York City Police Review Board in 1965.
               Kheel was also recruited as a peacemaker in the 1968 Ocean Hill-Brownsville Teachers
               dispute. </div>
            <div class="para"> Even though Kheel handled disputes for transit workers, typesetters, and longshoremen,
               he reveled in the finer things in life, and dabbled as a restaurateur in fine food
               and was a patron of the fine arts. </div>
            <div class="para"> He once owned a stake in Le Pavillon, a leading French restaurant in Manhattan, among
               others. He also represented numerous artists, including Robert Rauschenberg and Christo,
               and was the prime mover in the realization of the long-heralded Gates Project in Central
               Park in 2005. </div>
            <div class="para"> He also made millions of dollars as an entrepreneur while facilitating sustainable
               economic and social change. He was the lead investor in the giant Punta Cana resort,
               transforming 30 miles of jungle in the Dominican Republic, and helped bring about
               the airport that opened that country to tourists and travelers. </div>
            <div class="para"> Finding the solution to problems such as the impact of automation on the workplace,
               community disputes, and protecting a sustainable environment in which mankind will
               flourish, to name but a few, were the focus of Kheel's interest, enthusiasm, and financial
               support. He was the prime mover, bringing along like-minded citizens and specialists,
               in the creation of organizations to find solutions to the more intractable issues
               facing society. The Foundation on Employee Health, Medical Care and Welfare, the Foundation
               on Automation and Employment (and its British counterpart), Automation House, the
               Institute for Mediation and Conflict Resolution, and the Earth Pledge Foundation were
               among the most successful of such efforts. In the same vein, in collaboration with
               Price, Waterhouse in 1994, Kheel formed Prevention and Early Resolution of Conflicts,
               Inc. (PERC), now housed at Cornell ILR as Cornell/PERC Institute. </div>
            <div class="para"> A prolific writer, Kheel is perhaps best known for his encyclopedic work on labor
               law. Throughout a career that was active almost until his death at age 96 in November
               2010, he was able to balance, with amazing success, advocacy of the public good and
               the management of a successful law and mediation practice and other business and cultural
               interests.</div>  </a>
