            <div class="para">William Foote Whyte (June 27, 1914 July 16, 2000) was a sociologist chiefly known
               for his ethnographic study in urban sociology, Street Corner Society. </div>
            <div class="para"> Whyte, from an upper middle class background, showed an early interest in writing,
               economics and social reform. After graduating from Swarthmore College, he was selected
               for the Junior Fellows program, where his landmark research was done. After his research
               in Boston, he entered the sociology doctoral program at the University of Chicago.
               Street Corner Society was published by the University of Chicago Press in 1943. He
               spent a year teaching at the University of Oklahoma, but developed polio in 1943 and
               spent two years in physical therapy at the Warm Springs Foundation. Rehabilitation
               was only partially successful; Whyte walked with a cane for the rest of his life,
               and used two arm crutches in his later years. </div>
            <div class="para"> He briefly returned to the University of Chicago in 1944, then joined the New York
               State School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Cornell University in 1948, remaining
               at Cornell for the remainder of his career. He worked for social reform and social
               change, directing his efforts toward "empowering the disenfranchized and narrowing
               the gap between rich and poor." He studied industrial and agricultural workers and
               workers' cooperatives in Venezuela, Peru, Guatemala and in the Basque region of Spain,
               as well as in the United States. He authored hundreds of articles and 20 books including
               an autobiography. He is considered a pioneer in industrial sociology.</div>  </a>
