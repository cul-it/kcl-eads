            <div class="para">Founded in 1900 by local union delegates representing about 2,000 members in cities
               in the northeastern United States, the ILGWU grew in geographical scope, membership
               size, political influence to become one of the most powerful forces in American organized
               labor by mid-century. Representing workers in the women's garment industry, the ILGWU
               worked to improve working and living conditions of its members through collective
               bargaining agreements, training programs, health care facilities, cooperative housing,
               educational opportunities, and other efforts. In 1995, the ILGWU merged with the Amalgamated
               Clothing and Textile Workers Union (ACTWU) to form the Union of Needletrades, Industrial
               and Textile Employees (UNITE).</div>  </a>

            <div class="para">Born in Hungary in 1895 and after traveling in steerage with her mother and brothers
               to New York City, Jennie Matyas Charters began work in a garment factory as a child
               before eventually rising to become one of the first women vice presidents of the ILGWU.
               She became a member of Waistmakers' Local 25 in 1910 and during the strike of 1913
               was placed in charge of one of the large gathering halls. Matyas went on to become
               a shop chairperson in every shop she worked and helped establish education activities,
               but while her union career flourished, she never lost sight of her desire to continue
               her education. In 1922, Matyas left the ILGWU to attend college. Having relocated
               to the west coast, she found herself eager to help the union and began working as
               an organizer and educational director of the then Pacific Coast Office from 1934 to
               1941. Wanting to return to school, at age 47, Matyas enrolled at the University of
               California and graduated cum laude in economics in 1943. She was soon back to work
               with the union at the San Francisco Joint Board as education director and elected
               a vice president and member of the General Executive Board in 1944. </div>
            <div class="para">  Matyas retired in 1961 and was back in the classroom to receive her teaching credentials
               In 1970 at 75 years old, she started teaching adult education at a San Francisco community
               college. Matyas died on January 31, 1988 at the age of 93.</div>  </a>

            <div class="para">The collection consists of a bound volume of oral history interviews of Jennie Matyas
               Charters conducted by Corinne L. Gilb for a project to gather source material on California's
               cultural history. The interviews were tape recorded at Matyas' home in Marin County,
               California on April 20, May 5, June 14, June 29, July 26, August 9, and October 28,
               1955. Topics discussed by Matyas and reflected in the table of contents include: early
               life in Hungary, coming to America, working in the garment factories at the age of
               14, joining the union and her early activities with the union, discussions on socialism,
               women's suffrage and the communist infiltration, organizing, the union in California,
               and her continuing education.</div>  </a>
