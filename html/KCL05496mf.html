            <div class="para">This unpublished monograph was prepared by George Novak in 1957-1958 for the Labor
               Project of the Fund for the Republic, directed by Paul Jacobs. The Fund for the Republic
               was a non-profit education corporation created by the Ford Foundation in 1952 to counter
               pressures on civil liberties and basic freedoms from the political right. The Fund
               wanted to "support activities directed toward the elimination of restrictions on freedom
               of thought, inquiry and expression in the United States, and the development of policies
               and procedures best adapted to protect these rights."* </div>
            <div class="para"> The manuscript was written by George Novack, who had served the Consolidation Committee
               of Enginemen [CCE] as public relations advisor. The CCE was a powerful postwar nationwide
               caucus to affect the fusion of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers [BLE] and the
               Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen [BLF&amp;E]. It functioned within the
               framework of the two unions to achieve amalgamation through constitutional procedures.
               Beginning in April 1946 under the leadership of Russell R. Walker, the CCE attempted
               to mobilize the rank and file of the two labor unions in support of unification. The
               merger plan was defeated in May, 1949. </div>
            <div class="para"> Mr. Novak's manuscript describes the development of the CCE, its approach to the
               issue of unification, and its strategies for organizing in support of a merger. The
               CCE did succeed in having its program adopted by the conventions of both the Brotherhood
               of Locomotive Engineers and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Engineers. </div>
