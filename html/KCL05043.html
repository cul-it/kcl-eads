            <div class="para">U.S. Emergency Board No. 114 was convened in November of 1955 to settle the dispute
               engendered by the request of the Cooperating (Non-operating) Railroad Labor Organizationis
               to the Albany Port District Railroad and other carriers represented by the Eastern,
               Western, and Southeastern Carriers' Conference Committees that the latter ay the full
               cost of hospital, medical and surgical insurance and that they grant an increase of
               25 cents per hour to all existing rates of pay. </div>
            <div class="para"> After one month's deliberation, the Board recommended a fourteen and one-half cent
               increase and that the carriers assume and pay the full cost of the named health insurance.
               </div>
            <div class="para"> On April 1, 1955 the Organizations gave 30 days notice of a wish to modify the provisions
               of a memorandum of August 21, 1954 which established a contributory health and welfare
               program. The Organizations wished the Carriers to pay the full cost of the program.
               </div>
            <div class="para"> On August 1, 1955 the Organizations submitted an additional notice calling for an
               across-the-board pay increase of $.25 per hour. No agreement could be reached, as
               the Carriers believed the first issue was not for discussion, and their offer of a
               $.105 wage increase was declined. </div>
            <div class="para"> On September 15, 1955 the Organizations began circulating a strike ballot among the
               employees they represented. The National Mediation Board stepped in, and unable to
               achieve agreement offered arbitration which was turned down by the Organizations.
               </div>
            <div class="para"> On November 7, 1955 the President issued an executive order establishing the Emergency
               Board consisting of Dudley E. Whiting, Chairman, G. Allen Dash, Jr., member, and John
               Day Larkin, member. Hearings were held in Chicago from November 9 to November 30.
               The Board also met with the parties separately in an attempt to help them reach an
               agreement, but they were unsuccessful. The report to the President was submitted on
               December 12, 1955.</div>  </a>
