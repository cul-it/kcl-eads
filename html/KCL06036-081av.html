            <div class="para">The International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union was once one of the largest labor
               unions in the United States founded in 1900 by local union delegates representing
               about 2,000 members in cities in the northeastern United States. It was one of the
               first U.S. Unions to have a membership consisting of mostly females, and it played
               a key role in the labor history of the 1920s and 1930s. The union is generally referred
               to as the "ILGWU" or the "ILG". The ILGWU grew in geographical scope, membership size,
               and political influence to become one of the most powerful forces in American organized
               labor by mid-century. Representing workers in the women's garment industry, the ILGWU
               worked to improve working and living conditions of its members through collective
               bargaining agreements, training programs, health care facilities, cooperative housing,
               educational opportunities, and other efforts. The ILGWU merged with the Amalgamated
               Clothing and Textile Workers Union in 1995 to form the Union of Needle trades, Industrial
               and Textile Employees (UNITE). UNITE merged with the Hotel Employees and Restaurant
               Employees Union (HERE) in 2004 to create a new union known as UNITE HERE. The two
               unions that formed UNITE in 1995 represented only 250,000 workers between them, down
               from the ILGWU's peak membership of 450,000 in 1969.</div>  </a>

            <div class="para">Ruth Rubinstein Graeber was born March 1, 1917. As a member of ILGWU Local 32 Corset
               and Brassiere workers, she was involved in the courses and activities offered by her
               local, mainly the dance classes. When the dance classes she attended were cancelled
               due to low enrollment, Graeber was told of the various classes and offerings available
               at Labor Stage. While applying for the dance classes at Labor Stage, Graeber was instead
               put in the drama classes where she became an actress and performer. She was a member
               of the original "Pins &amp; Needles" cast, spending two and a half years on Broadway and
               with the touring company. Graeber had solos in the numbers "Mussolini Handicap," "Economics
               I," and her most famous performance "Chain Store Daisy" ("Vassar Girl Finds a Job").
               After the end of "Pins &amp; Needles," Graeber took a three month vacation before returning
               to work in the shop. She died on March 15, 2006.</div>  </a>

            <div class="para">"Sing me a song with social significance"began the musical comedy revue "Pins and
               Needles." Produced by the Educational Department of the International Ladies' Garment
               Workers' Union (ILGWU), the show with an amateur cast of garment workers won critics
               and audiences to become the longest running musical of the 1930s. </div>
            <div class="para"> The Educational Department began to expand beyond its original function of educating
               workers in labor culture, and soon started to offer recreational outlets for members
               including art, music and dance. In 1934, the department was reorganized under new
               director Mark Starr to create three divisions, Cultural, Recreational and Education,
               managed by Julius Hochman, Louis Schaffer, and Starr respectively. The Cultural Division
               offered classes in drama, acting, dance and music, and also organized a chorus and
               orchestra composed of union members. For years members had been trying to develop
               and present labor themed plays, and while many locals were successful in staging small
               productions, the drama department became formally established in the fall of 1934.
               With Schaffer joining the staff of the ILGWU in October 1934, a dramatic group, the
               ILGWU Players, was formed from members of several locals. Professionals were recruited
               to instruct the classes, and Schaffer envisioned broadening the scope of the department
               to create a venture that brought the labor movement to Broadway. At the American Federation
               of Labor (AFL) Convention in 1935, Schaffer, with the encouragement of ILGWU President
               David Dubinsky, introduced the idea of establishing founding a theater company for
               New York City's labor movement. With enthusiastic support, Labor Stage, Inc. a non-profit
               with revenue supporting the Educational Department, was established in 1935 with financial
               backing from the ILGWU. The union leased the Princess Theatre and began renovating
               the space to become Labor Stage, housing an intimate auditorium, studio and rehearsal
               space and dressing rooms, with a dedication in January 1936. </div>
            <div class="para"> Schaffer soon set to work to make his vision, "Pins and Needles," a realitya revue
               style production that slyly satirized politics and the elite while skewering current
               events staged for working men and women. Harold Rome was brought in to write the music
               and lyrics, numerous writers contributed sketches, and Charles Friedman was hired
               to direct (though he would later be replaced by Robert Gordon). Union members and
               others active in the Educational Department were encouraged to audition, and a cast
               of fifty five garment workers were selected and began extensive rehearsals. The performers
               were not professionals, and in addition to learning their lines and songs, were also
               instructed in the fundamentals of acting and basic stage movement. In June of 1936,
               Schaffer staged an early version of "Pins and Needles" using a professional cast to
               demonstrate the numbers, and though well received, Schaffer chose the unorthodox decision
               to proceed with the cast of untrained garment workers. The official opening was delayed
               for almost a year and a half to make sure the performers, who were still working in
               the factories during the day, had sufficient time to practice and rehearse. </div>
            <div class="para"> On July 4, 1937, the cast traveled to Unity House, the union's vacation resort in
               the Poconos, for additional rehearsals that lasted ten days and concluded with a close
               to completion trial performance of the show. After numerous adjustments and fine tuning,
               "Pins and Needles" held its first invitation only performance at Labor Stage on November
               6, 1937. After additional postponements, finally, on Saturday, November 27, 1937,
               "Pins and Needles" opened to the public. The critics were favorable and with good
               reviews and word of mouth, the show became an instant hit. The box office was busy
               and tickets in high demand, and by January 1938, performances were sold out. Since
               the performers were still working full time in the garment factories, initially the
               show only played on the weekends. The garment workers were given leaves of absence
               from their factory jobs to become full-time actors with pay to accommodate the increased
               show schedule which now included nightly performances. When the primary target audience,
               union members, found it difficult to obtain tickets to see the show, a second performing
               company was organized to provide daily late afternoon matinees for the workers. Close
               to fifty skits were created during the course of "Pins and Needles," of which nineteen
               to twenty-two were performed at each performance, including such favorites as "Sunday
               in the Park," "One Big Union for Two," and "Lesson in Etiquette." Revisions were continually
               made throughout the three editions, with sketches and songs added and deleted as the
               show evolved to adjust and adapt and remain current and timely. </div>
            <div class="para"> While the show ignored references to racial issues on the stage, behind the scenes
               racial inequality abounded. Olive Pearman was the first African American cast in the
               show and initially only had a supporting role and worked as the seamstress on the
               road. Additional African American cast members were added later after pressure on
               Schaffer, including Dorothy Tucker and Dorothy Harrison, but no Hispanics appeared
               in the productions. Other cast members were pressured to suppress their Jewish ethnicities
               and forgo religious observances during performance schedules, some changing names
               and a few altering their appearances. On the road during the touring productions,
               the African American cast members were often forced to follow local segregation laws
               in the cities where they were performing and encountered prejudice in finding accommodations,
               eating with the cast in a restaurant, or in the extreme case, being unable to perform.
               </div>
            <div class="para"> To bring the show to audiences outside of New York City, a ten month national tour
               of "Pins and Needles" began in April 1938 visiting cities Philadelphia, Boston, Los
               Angeles, San Francisco, and Chicago, as well as smaller towns in between as the cast
               made their way across the United States. For many cast members, this was their first
               time traveling away from New York and their families, and especially traversing the
               country on train. Stays in the larger cities were often extended, and in many instances
               the cast was greeted by members from local unions. Multiple companies were formed
               to accommodate the expanding schedule between touring, evenings and matinees. The
               original company went on the national road tour, second and third companies formed
               to perform the evening shows and matinees for union members. As the cast multiplied,
               so did the number of "ringers," or semi-professionals. Schaffer started adding "ringers,"
               talented ILGWU members, and individuals with aspirations to become professional actors
               to replace the initially amateur cast, which created tensions among the various companies.
               </div>
            <div class="para"> In March 1938 in the East Room of the White House, a smaller cast performed for President
               Franklin Roosevelt and Eleanor, whom had already seen the show several times. Afterward,
               the cast and crew performed another condensed version of "Pins and Needles" for the
               twenty-fifth anniversary of the U.S. Department of Labor. The first road show ended
               on January 30, 1939 after 319 performances in 34 cities across the country. The original
               company that was still remaining headed back to New York to find the new casts filling
               all the roles and numerous new numbers added to show. Unfortunately, most of the original
               and road show cast were forced to return back to their jobs in the garment factories
               as many became phased out by semi-professional replacements. The second and revamped
               edition of "Pins and Needles" debuted on April 21, 1939 and on June 26, 1939, the
               show moved to the larger Windsor Theatre. The new edition proved successful, and finally,
               a third edition of the show, "New Pins and Needles," opened on November 20, 1939.
               After 1,108 performances, "Pins and Needles" closed in New York City on June 22, 1940.
               The second national tour began a month later and toured the country before playing
               its last show in Los Angeles on May 31, 1941. After the end of "Pins and Needles,"
               Labor Stage did not put on another play and closed. The actors returned to the shops
               and factories, with only a few trying to turn their experience into a career in show
               business. "Pins and Needles" challenged the idea of labor sponsored entertainment
               to become a popular hit with memorable lyrics, hummable tunes, and a social message
               that appealed to a broad audience.</div>  </a>
         
         <hr><a name="a3">
            
            
            <div class="para">The collection consists of a DVD recording of a program at the Muhlenberg Branch of
               the New York Public Library on December 4, 1997. Ruth Rubinstein Graeber was invited
               to speak about the history of "Pins &amp; Needles" and her experience as an original cast
               member in the show. Graeber recounted her time rehearsing and performing and had displayed
               posters with photographs from the show, and at the end of her talk she plays a recording
               of her singing "Chain Store Daisy." Also in the audience at the library and identified
               in the video were Elise Bregman Bretton, Eugene Goldstein, and Nettie Harary Schrog.
               Graeber begins with recounting the history of Labor Stage, the ILGWU's involvement,
               the classes and activities offered, and the drama group that sought to produce labor
               themed plays. She tells of her own history as a member of Local 32 Corset and Brassiere
               workers and her involvement in dance classes offered by her local before she came
               to Labor Stage and was recruited by the drama department. She talks of how "Pins &amp;
               Needles" came about and the amount of work and rehearsals that went into the show
               before it was ready to debut. Graeber had solos in the numbers "Mussolini Handicap"
               and "Economics I" and then rehearsed privately with the director for a new number
               "Chain Store Daisy" (Vassar Girl Finds a Job). She was initially concerned that she
               had so many solos in the show over the other cast members. </div>
            <div class="para"> When "Pins &amp; Needles" opened, Graeber discusses the popularity of the show and mentions
               how all the celebrities that went to see it were brought backstage to have photographs
               taken with the cast. With sold out performances, the cast needed to take leaves of
               absences from their jobs so that "Pins &amp; Needles" could play nightly. Graeber recounts
               that she was earning $22/23 a week as a piece worker and needed it to help her family
               so couldn't make any less in her new job as an actor. She remembers that Burgess Meredith,
               who was head of the Actors Equity Union came to speak to the cast about joining the
               union, though management did not want to pay the higher wages required ($40 a week
               for actors). A compromise was reached in where eight of the performers joined the
               union as actors while the remaining members of the show were counted as the chorus.
               With "Pins &amp; Needles playing every night, Graeber states that an additional 5:30 p.m.
               show for union members for $.25 a ticket was added and performed by a second company.
               </div>
            <div class="para"> Graeber tells in great detail her experience of going to the White House to perform
               for President and Mrs. Roosevelt. The cast only knew that they were going to play
               a condensed version of the show with the strongly satirical and possibly offensive
               numbers cut, at a dinner for the Department of Labor, a Labor Gala with 1,200 people.
               It was kept a secret until only a few hours before that Graeber and the cast would
               perform in the East Room. Graeber remembers the strict security by the secret service,
               an out of tune gold plated piano, a curtain strung up across the room, and shaking
               hands with the president who said something to each cast member. Mrs. Roosevelt served
               punch and cookies afterward. On April 19, 1938, Graeber discusses the first stop in
               Philadelphia, for the road show that lasted eight months and took her and the cast
               across the U. S. and Canada.</div>  </a>
