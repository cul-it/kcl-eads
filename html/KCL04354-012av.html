            <div class="para">Peter Lazes was the founder and Director of the Healthcare Transformation Project
               within Cornell University's School of Industrial and Labor Relations. The Healthcare
               Transformation Project was established in 1997 to assist union and management healthcare
               leaders create integrated delivery systems to improve patient care and reduce costs.
               This program provided labor union and management leaders with customized consulting,
               research, and educational programs to implement strategic worker participation programs.
               His work involved assisting hospitals and healthcare organizations to develop methods
               to improve patient care and reduce costs with a focus on frontline staff engagement.
               </div>
            <div class="para">In addition to his work with the Healthcare Transformation Project, he has served
               as a consultant for organizations in a variety of sectors and written over 30 articles
               and produced several videos on topics such as organizational change, innovation and
               new work systems, new roles for unions, and strategies for keeping American jobs.
               Dr. Lazes's international activities included consulting and education programs in
               Ireland, Poland, Norway, and UK. Peter received his Ph.D. in clinical and industrial
