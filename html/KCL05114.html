            <p></p>
            
            <div class="para">The New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) was created by Governor Thomas E. Dewey
               on March 20, 1953, removing the control of the city's public transportation from the
               New York City Board of Transportation (NYCBOT) and placing it under the control of
               a public authority. The three subway companies, the Interborough Rapid Transit Company
               (IRT), the Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT), and the public Independent
               Subway System (IND), which had been unified under direct city control in 1940 under
               the NYCBOT were now under the control of the NYCTA, along with the surface transportation
               systems. The governor created this authority, over the objections of many New York
               City politicians, liberals, and labor groups, to address the major financial issues
               faced by the system. The NYCTA signed a 10-year lease with the city on June 1, 1953
               and took over operations on June 15, 1953, after surviving a suit brought by taxpayers
               and the city itself, alleging that the NYCTA was unconstitutional. </div>
            <div class="para"> Under the NYCTA, the transit system was to be fully supported by the fares paid by
               its riders. As a result, the fare was raised to 15 cents, and a token system was introduced.
               The fare increase, however, was not enough to close the operating deficit and the
               NYCTA began to look at other ways to defray costs, including service cuts and elimination
               of union positions. The president of the Transit Workers Union (TWU), Michael J. Quill,
               threatened a rule-book slow-down unless the NYCTA negotiated a new contract with the
               TWU as well as discussing service cuts with the union. Quill asked Mayor Vincent Impelliteri
               to appoint an arbitration panel; after first refusing, the Mayor eventually agreed,
               and the matter of service cuts was resolved. However, new contract provisions were
               not. </div>
            <div class="para"> On December 14, 1953, contract negotiations between the transit employees and the
               Transit Authority came to a halt. Quill warned the NYCTA that when the existing contract
               expired on January 1, 1954, his men would walk off their jobs. Since Quill's union
               represented 34,000 of the 44,000 transit employees, it was obvious that his "no contract,
               no work" policy would mean a complete shut-down of New York City's transportation
               facilities. </div>
            <div class="para"> In an effort to head off the impending strike, Mayor-Elect Robert F. Wagner Jr. proposed
               that a fact-finding committee be appointed to look into the contract dispute. Both
               sides agreed to meet before the impartial committee while making it known that they
               would not be bound by its recommendations. With the threat of a strike momentarily
               mitigated, Mayor Wagner was able to create a three-member panel for the fact-finding
               committee. The fact-finding committee began a series of hearings in January 1954 where
               the following records were submitted by both the NYCTA and the transit employees for
               consideration. </div>

            <div class="para"> This collection is comprised of briefs, statements of support, and exhibits submitted
               by the TWU and its supporters to the New York City Transit Fact Finding Board in support
               of their proposed contract provisions; the collection also contains the exhibits presented
               by the NYCTA in support of their position that they could not meet the TWU's demands.
               </div>
            <div class="para"> In addition to the TWU's proposed contract revisions and supporting exhibits, this
               collection also contains two supplemental briefs from the Civil Service Forum of New
               York, a collection of union exhibits documenting various contracts between public
               and private transportation companies and municipal authorities; of note is the arbitration
               award and agreement between Boston's Metropolitan Transit Authority, precursor to
               the Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority (MBTA), and the Amalgamated Association of
               Street, Electric Railway, and Motor Coach Employees (AFSCME), Division 589, which
               is mentioned in the union exhibits as source material for the Fact Finding Board to
               examine. Another AFSCME Local, Local 380, submitted a paper titled, "An American Standard
               of Living for The Transit Workers of America's Largest City." </div>
            <div class="para"> The NYCTA's submissions to the Fact Finding Board present in the collection are two
               documents, with exhibits, detailing the financial crises facing the transportation
               system that arose in conjunction with the consolidation of the three independent transit
               lines in New York and the cost of maintain such a large public transportation system,
               as well as detailing comparable rates of pay from other transportation systems.</div>  </a>
