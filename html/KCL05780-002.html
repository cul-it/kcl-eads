         <div class="item">The David Dubinsky correspondence consists of five series arranged as indicated in
            the Scope and Content section. The original order of the collection, except for misfilings,
            has been maintained as it was found. The records were originally filed in the President's
            office at ILGWU headquarters building, 1710 Broadway, New York City. Upon Mr. Dubinsky's
            retirement as President in 1966, they were transferred into a storage area of that
            building until February of 1974, when they were removed to the newly established Archives.
            With the exception of David Dubinsky Personal Correspondence Series, those qualified
            to gain access to the Archives may freely consult the entire D.D. Collection. No documents
            have been removed except letters of potential autograph value and disintegrating newspaper
            clippings. In all cases, removed materials have been replaced by facsimile copies.</div>

            <div class="para">The International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union was once one of the largest labor
               unions in the United States founded in 1900 by local union delegates representing
               about 2,000 members in cities in the northeastern United States. It was one of the
               first U.S. Unions to have a membership consisting of mostly females, and it played
               a key role in the labor history of the 1920s and 1930s. The union is generally referred
               to as the "ILGWU" or the "ILG". The ILGWU grew in geographical scope, membership size,
               and political influence to become one of the most powerful forces in American organized
               labor by mid-century. Representing workers in the women's garment industry, the ILGWU
               worked to improve working and living conditions of its members through collective
               bargaining agreements, training programs, health care facilities, cooperative housing,
               educational opportunities, and other efforts. The ILGWU merged with the Amalgamated
               Clothing and Textile Workers Union in 1995 to form the Union of Needle trades, Industrial
               and Textile Employees (UNITE). UNITE merged with the Hotel Employees and Restaurant
               Employees Union (HERE) in 2004 to create a new union known as UNITE HERE. The two
               unions that formed UNITE in 1995 represented only 250,000 workers between them, down
               from the ILGWU's peak membership of 450,000 in 1969.</div>  </a>
