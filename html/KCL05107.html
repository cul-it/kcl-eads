            <div class="para">Section I </div>
            <div class="para"> In 1910 the clothing industry was made up of many small tailor shops, the Chicago
               Wholesale Clothiers Association (an organization of large firms) and Hart, Schaffner
               and Marx, the one big firm which refused to join the Association. As competition forced
               the smaller shops out of independent existence, many of them turned to contract work
               for the larger shops. Finally, Hart, Schaffner and Marx withdrew all their work from
               the contractors and opened inside shops, employing over 8,000 workers. </div>
            <div class="para"> This was the signal for both groups to try to reduce their labor costs and the worker
               was caught in the middle. Almost without exception they were recent immigrants from
               several European nations who had learned their trade at home and had no other skill.
               They were without a common language, unable to speak English and had no knowledge
               of industrial conditions in America. Few of them were organized in a trade union,
               the work was seasonal in character and an abundant supply of labor was available so
               that the worker's earnings were low and his hours excessive. </div>
            <div class="para"> Wages averaged from four to fourteen dollars a week and the day began at 7:30 a.m.
               and lasted until six. On September 22, 1910 Hart, Schaffner and Marx reduced the rate
               for seaming pants from four cents a pair to 3.74 cents. Several girls walked out rather
               than accept the cut, and this unexpectedly provoked an immediate response in the other
               shops. </div>
            <div class="para"> A group of workers appealed to District Council 6 of the United Garment Workers for
               help, but not until more than 18,000 had walked off the job and the Chicago Daily
               Socialist threatened to publish a call for a general strike did the Council act. Then
               the strike grew so fast they were unable to handle it alone. </div>
            <div class="para"> The Chicago Federation of Labor and the Women's Trade Union League supported the
               strikers and early in November a Joint Strike Conference Board was set up. </div>
            <div class="para"> On November 5, the United Garment Workers signed an agreement with Hart, Schaffner
               and Marx, alone, and when it was presented to the workers they turned it down. A second
               agreement was proposed in December and voted down. </div>
            <div class="para"> On January 11, 1911 Hart, Schaffner and Marx and the United Garment Workers agreed
               to a settlement which stipulated that all employees be returned to work without discrimination
               against union members, and an arbitration committee of three be chosen to settle all
               grievances. </div>
            <div class="para"> The Joint Board selected Clarence Darrow as their arbitrator and Hart, Schaffner
               end Marx chose Carl Meyer. Unable to secure a third arbitrator, the parties agreed
               that the Board of Arbitration would be made up of only two. Among the first recommendations
               of the new board was one suggesting the company provide a means of handling grievances
               which resulted in setting up a Labor Complaint Department. During its first year the
               Department handled over 800 complaints. The arbitrators met fifty times and handed
               down twenty written decisions and many oral ones. </div>
            <div class="para"> The system, however, was not satisfactory. It still took too long for a case to be
               decided and discontent grew. A conference proposed that a committee of five (two from
               the company, two from the union and a fifth chosen by the four) be appointed to formulate
               rules and adjust prices. This committee created a Trade Board of eleven members whose
               decisions would be binding unless appealed to the Board of Arbitration in three days.
               </div>
            <div class="para"> Later the Trade Board was reduced to five members and a third person selected for
               the Board of Arbitration. A new agreement was signed in 1913 which continued in effect
               through the period of the formation of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers and the general
               strikes of 1915-16. There were no work stoppages at Hart, Schaffner and Marx. </div>
            <div class="para"> John E. Williams served as impartial chairman of the Board of Arbitration from 1912
               until his death in 1919. James H. Tufts served until 1921, when he was succeeded by
               Harry A. Millis. In 1923 William M. Leiserson became impartial chairman. </div>
            <div class="para"> * Section II </div>
            <div class="para"> On February 3, 1911 the United Garment Workers called off the general strike. The
               workers slowly trickled back to the other firms without any agreement. Dissatisfaction
               with the United Garment Workers came to a head in the 191?- convention at Nashville
               when a rump convention elected a second slate of officers, which in a second convention
               adopted the name of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers. </div>
            <div class="para"> The Amalgamated launched an organizing drive in the summer of 1915 and at a mass
               meeting in Chicago in September a list of demands on the non-union manufacturers was
               drawn up with an ultimatum that if they were not met a general strike would be called.
               The strike lasted until December 12, 1915, and although the union was not recognized,
               several concessions were made by the employers. </div>
            <div class="para"> Organization of the market continued, but it was not until May 1919 that all of the
               associations recognized the union. In that agreement arbitration machinery patterned
               after the experience under the Hart, Schaffner and Marx agreement was set up. Although
               there were separate agreements and separate impartial machinery set up, the personnel
               of the two boards were the same. In the late 30's the boards were merged to form a
               single trade board and a single board of arbitration for the entire market.</div>  </a>
