         <div class="item">Documents relating to Board 130 consist of briefs. Documents relating to Emergency
            Board 145 include transcripts of proceedings (15 vol.), final report and related documents,
            carrier and employee briefs, and exhibits. Carrier exhibits include documents relating
            to rates of pay, working conditions, job descriptions, and fringe benefits in the
            railroad industry, especially regarding non-operating employees. Also comparative
            wage data for clericals and workers in other industries. Employee exhibits include
            job descriptions of shop craft, firemen and oilers, standards for interindustry wage
            comparisons and tables of wage trends (1949-1958) for non-operating railroad employees
            and comparable American workers. Also documents relating to the financial stability
            of the railroad industry and railroad worker productivity. Additionally, includes
            a manuscript copy of the final report of the Board and newspaper clippings and other
            papers which document public reaction to the decision.</div>

            <div class="para"> Emergency Board No. 130 dealt with a dispute arising out of the vacations with pay,
               wages, and improvements in health and welfare plans. The Board recommended a general
               wage rate increase of five cents per hour, additional carrier contributions to dependent
               benefits and group life insurance, and a seventeen cents per hour, cost-of-living
               adjustment. </div>
            <div class="para"> Emergency Board No. 145 was created to settle an impasse arising out of "section
               6" notices served by the parties on each other, proposing changes in existing agreements.
               The organizations proposed a twenty-five cents per hour wage increase and six months
               advance notice of reduction in force. The Carriers' Conference Committees countered
               with a request for a wage reduction and the abolition of provisions which required
               more than 24 hours notice of reduction in force. The Board recommended a four cents
               per hour increase, effective immediately, plus a two and one-half per cent increase,
               effective three months thereafter. It also recommended a rule requiring not less than
               five working days notice of force reduction.</div>  </a>
