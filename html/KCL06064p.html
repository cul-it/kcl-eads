            <div class="para">Sidney Hillman (March 23, 1887-July 10, 1946) was an American labor leader. He was
               head of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America and instrumental in the creation
               of the Congress of Industrial Organizations. He encouraged labor's support of Franklin
               Delano Roosevelt and the Democratic Party. </div>
            <div class="para"> Sidney Hillman was born in Lithuania, he emigrated to America in 1907. He landed
               in New York City, and after finding a poor job market, he moved on to Chicago, where
               the job market was better. He found work in the garment industry as an apprentice.
               </div>
            <div class="para"> In 1910 due to a citywide strike of 45,000 garment workers against the company Hart
               Schaffner &amp; Marx, the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America was formed, because
               the garment workers were so unhappy with the agreement the United Garment Workers
               had come up with. </div>
            <div class="para"> Hillman became Chief Clerk within the International Ladie's Garment Workers' Union
               in early 1914. The union workers that formed Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America
               started contacting Hillman and wanted him to take over as President, the most persuasive
               letter came from Bessie Abramowitz, who was one of the original leaders of the Chicago
               strike, and also Hillman's fiance. He accepted the offer and left the ILG the next
               year. </div>
            <div class="para"> Sidney and Bessie married in 1916, and had two daughters. </div>
            <div class="para"> Hillman's leadership encouraged the "constructive cooperation" between employers
               in the industry to impose industry wide working standards, which would take wages
               and hours out of the dispute equation. Hillman worked to get companies to use arbitration
               to settle disputes. </div>
            <div class="para"> The Great Depression of 19291939 strengthened Hillman's belief in the importance
               of a strong partnership between government and labor. He was named to the Labor Advisory
               Board of the National Recovery Administration in 1933 and to the National Industrial
               Recovery Board in 1934. One of his closest advisers helped Sen. Robert Wagner draft
               the historic labor legislation that became the National Labor Relations Act. And Hillman
               himself worked closely with Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins to draft a comprehensive
               wage and hours bill that eventually became the Fair Labor Standards Act. </div>
            <div class="para"> Hillman helped create the Committee for Industrial Organization in 1935. In 1937,
               Hillman pulled ACWA (which had re-affiliated with the AFL in 1933) out of the AFL,
               joining John L. Lewis and others to found the Congress of Industrial Organizations
               (CIO). Elected first vice president of the CIO in 1937, Hillman headed up its Textile
               Workers Organizing Committee and its Department Store Workers Organizing Committee.
               </div>
            <div class="para"> The Textile Workers Union of America came to life in 1939, with more than 100,000
               members, and that led directly to the creation of the Retail, Wholesale and Department
               Store Workers Union of America. </div>
            <div class="para"> In both World War I and World War II, Hillman used the influence of the federal government
               to advance labor's social goals and its organizing needs. He was a strong supporter
               of Roosevelt and campaigned for him in both elections. At times leaving the labor
               industry wondering if he was leaving the labor movement behind. </div>
            <div class="para"> The Sydney Hillman Foundation established in his honor, gives annual awards to journalists
               and writers for work that supoorts social justice and progressive public policy. </div>
            <div class="para"> Bessie Abramowitz (May 15, 1889-December 23, 1970) </div>
            <div class="para"> Bessie Abramowitz Hillman devoted her life to unions, organizing her first strike
               at fifteen, announcing her engagement on a picket line, and continuing her fight for
               workers' rights untill her death. </div>
            <div class="para"> Bessie immigrated to America alone at fifteen and started work sewing buttons in
               a garment factory while attending night school at Hull House, run by suffragette Jane
               Addams. Abramowitz organized workers for the Women's Trade Union League all along
               the East Coast, and then went on to become education director of the Laundry Workers
               Joint Board in 1937. Through Laundry Workers, she became involved in civil rights
               issues, serving with the CIO and AFL-CIO. She also worked with the Child Welfare Committee
               of New York, the Defense Advisory Commission on Women in the Services, and President
               Kennedy's Commission on the Status of Women, among many others. </div>
