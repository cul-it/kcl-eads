            <div class="para">The Joint Board of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America coordinated union activities
               in the Rochester, N.Y. area. </div>
            <div class="para">  In 1915, the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America (ACWA) embarked on a large-scale
               organizing drive in Rochester, N.Y. After four years of extensive organizing, the
               union succeeded in forcing the Rochester Clothiers' Exchange (the main organization
               of employers) into adopting a 44-hour workweek. By 1929, the union had succeeded in
               unionizing over 12,000 of Rochester's clothing workers.</div>  </a>

            <div class="para">Consists of the minutes of the Rochester Joint Board from 1919 through 1932. The meetings
               are divided, for the most part, into the following sections: communications, bills,
               expenditures, financial statements, Board of Directors' reports, reports from affiliated
               locals, the manager's reports, education committee reports, grievance committee reports,
               and outside committee reports. </div>
            <div class="para"> Beyond the usual issues of collective bargaining, wages, grievances, strikes, organizing
               campaigns, local union administration and economic conditions in the clothing industry
               which are addressed throughout these minutes, much space is given to the Joint Board's
               response to contemporary social and political issues. National and local union issues
               discussed that are of special interest include the needs of women workers in the garment
               industry (1919, 1925) and the election of a female business agent (1919, 1927), claims
               of discrimination in job placement by the union (1925), attempts by Italian union
               members to form a cooperative (1926), the "pernicious" effect of communist attacks
               on union leadership, the roots of factionalism in the Rochester Joint Board (1926-1929),
               and the issue of racketeering in the union (1932). </div>
            <div class="para"> Rochester strikes discussed include the Off Pressers Strike and the Shop 5 Stein
               Block Sitdown Strike (1927) among others. Important strikes around the nation were
               often alluded to in the minutes, with the Joint Board offering moral support and occasional
               financial contributions to the relevant strike funds. Of special interest were the
               Buffalo Clothing Workers' Strike (1919), the United Shoe Workers' Strike (1922), the
               Paterson, N.J. Silk Workers' Strike (1924), the Syracuse, N.Y. Bakery Strike (1925)
               and several strikes in 1926, including those of the United Mine Workers and the United
               Shoe Workers as well as the Passaic, N.J. General Strike. </div>
            <div class="para"> Social and political issues of concern to the Joint Board as reflected in the minutes
               include relations with the Socialist Party, the imprisonment of Tom Mooney, the movement
               to create a Farmer-Labor Party, the plight of immigrants, economic downturns and the
               execution of Sacco and Vanzetti. The Board supported Jewish charities, aid to Russia
               and various anti-fascist Italian movements. It also endorsed the La Follette-Wheeler
               ticket in the 1924 presidental campaign. The Joint Board opposed "class-collaborationism"
               as expressed in the B&amp;O Plan, attacked "reactionary" labor leaders of the "Gompers
               and Lewis type," and called for the abolition of militarism. </div>
            <div class="para"> The minutes also record speeches by Jean Longuet, Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, and Roger
               Baldwin.</div>  </a>
