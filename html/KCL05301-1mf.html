            <p></p>
            
            <div class="para">The first interstate agreements in the bituminous coal industry were negotiated by
               the National Federation of Miners and Mine Laborers with the coal mine operators of
               Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois during the period 1885 to 1889. The annual
               interstate conferences held during these years attempted to establish uniform wage
               and working conditions throughout the area later known as the Central Competitive
               Field. The parties to the negotiations felt that by joint agreement they could mitigate
               the manifold hardships suffered by the miners and many operators which came as a result
               of the overproduction of coal, destructive cut-throat competition within the industry,
               irregular employment, continual reductions of wages, and the many bitter strikes and
               lockouts which marked the period prior to 1885. </div>
            <div class="para"> The interstate conference system collapsed when the miners and operators failed to
               reach an agreement in 1889. The break-up of this system may be attributed largely
               to the worsening economic condition of the coal trade at this time, but much credit
               must be given to the disrupting effect of the existing union rivalry between the Federation
               of Miners and National District Assembly No. 135 of the Knights of Labor. The Knights
               had had a large following among the coal miners for some time, but saw no need for
               a special miners organization until the National Federation appeared on the scene
               in 1885. </div>
            <div class="para"> The existence of two national miners' organizations each contending for leadership
               of the nation's coal miners was also a source of distress to many of the operators.
               The operators insisted upon uniform enforcement of the agreement throughout the competitive
               area, and the Knights recalcitrance often made this impossible. Having had no voice
               in the making of the agreements, the Knights refused in many instances to honor its
               provisions in areas where NDA-135 was the predominant organization. The failure of
               the Knights to maintain the competitive rates established by the interstate conference
               led many operators to abrogate the agreement in competitive self-defense, and thus
               led to the collapse of the bargaining system. </div>
            <div class="para"> Seeing the part which union rivalry had played in disrupting the interstate conference
               system, the two organizations merged in 1890 to form the United Mine Workers of America.
               The new organization moved immediately to revive the interstate conferences in the
               Central Competitive Field, but the struggle to get the nation's major coal operators
               into interstate negotiations proved very difficult for the weak, but growing, union
               during the depression years of the eighteen nineties. </div>
            <div class="para"> The resumption of interstate negotiations and the first "industry-wide" agreement
               signed by the United Mine Workers came in 1898. From this time until pattern setting
               in the Central Competitive Field was abandoned in 1927, the nation's miners and operators
               met annually or biennially to jointly determine wages and working conditions for most
               of the nation's bituminous coal industry. Contracts for the outlying fields - the
               Southwestern Competitive Field (Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas and Missouri), and
               individual fields such as Northern West Virginia, Central Pennsylvania, the Iowa Field
               and colorado - were negotiated in conformity with the terms and provisions of the
               Interstate Joint Agreement. </div>
            <div class="para"> The United Mine Workers divided the coal regions of the United States into geographic
               subdivisions or districts in order to facilitate union administration and regional
               negotiations. The districts generally followed state boundaries, but the key factor
               in determining district boudaries is the geological nature of the coal fields which
               are grouped together. The number of union members in an area or the size of the coal
               region was not a factor in determining the boundaries of districts. Pennsylvania,
               for instance, contained seven districts of the UMW. Some districts, but not all, were
               divided into subdistricts if there was enough variation in geologic structure throughout
               the district to create significant differences in mining conditions. For most of the
               time period with which this record group is concerned, the UMW was divided into 28
               districts. Five of these districts were in the Central Competitive Field: District
               5, Western Pennsylvania; District 6, Ohio: District 8, the Block Coal Field of Indiana;
               District 11, Indiana; and the keystone of the union, District 12, Illinois. </div>
            <div class="para"> District 12, which encompasses the entire state of Illinois and contains 11 subdistricts,
               has been a center of strong union activity since the first union among the bituminous
               coal miners in the United States, the American Miners Association, was formed in southern
               Illinois in 1861. In terms of membership, District 12 has always been the largest
               in the union, and no other district could match it in coal production. During periods
               when unionism among the miners might be at a very low ebb, district 12 could always
               be counted upon to be strongly organized and operating under a collective agreement.
               The district has also produced some of the greatest leaders of the UMW, such as John
               Mitchell and John L. Lewis. District 12 has also been the birthplace of much rebellion
               and dissension within the union. </div>
            <div class="para"> The operators in Illinois, who were the second party to the collective agreement,
               had no such centralized and unified organization as the UMW. Up until about the middle
               of 1910, most of the major coal companies in Illinois held membership in the Illinois
               Coal Operators' Association which was organized in 1897. during a strike in 1910 the
               operators of the 5th and 9th districts of Illinois broke away from the ICOA and formed
               the Coal Operators' Association of the Fifth and Ninth Districts of Illinois. </div>
            <div class="para"> In 1914, the operators of the Springfield District formed the Central Illinois coal
               Operators' Association. From 1914, then, to 1928, three operators' associations dealt
               with District 12. It has been stated that the reason for separate organizations was
               to be found chiefly in the diversity of mining conditions in the different parts of
               the state. In 1928 the two smaller organizations rejoined the ICOA in order to deal
               with the union more effectively. </div>
            <div class="para"> The district and subdistrict agreements also specified the prices to be paid for
               deadwork, powder, house coal, and rent on company houses. Local agreements between
               the miners and the operator of a particular mine dealt with conditions of employment
               affecting only one mine such as exceptionally long distances to walk from the bottom
               of the shaft to the working places, the beginning and quitting of work, the lunch
               hour, and other minor working conditions.</div>  </a>

               William B. Wilson for nationwide agreements in the coal mining industry; and the need
               to organize West Virginia miners if District 12 coal prices were to remain competitive.
