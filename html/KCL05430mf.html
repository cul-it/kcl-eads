            <div class="para">Morris Hillquit is considered by some to have been the foremost spokesman and theoretician
               of the Socialist Party of America from its founding in 1901 until his death in 1933.
               As author, politician and labor attorney, Hillquit took a centrist position in the
               Party and worked to further the Social Democratic ideals of political activism, unionism
               and international brotherhood among workers. </div>
            <div class="para"> Morris Hillquit emigrated to the United States from Russia in 1896 and worked first
               in the New York City garment trade until joining the staff of the ARBEITER ZEITUNG
               in 1890. A member of the Socialist Labor Party, Hillquit led the "Rochester faction"
               in its secession from the SLP in 1899. This group merged with the Social Democratic
               Party in 1901 to form the Socialist Party of America. As a member of the United Hebrew
               Trades, Hillquit helped to organize garment workers in New York City while obtaining
               an LL.B. from New York Law School in 1893. Hillquit was a member of the negotiating
               committee which settled the 1910 New York Cloakmakers' Strike which led to the Protocol
               of Peace, establishing machinery to conciliate labor disputes in the garment industry.
               Hillquit served as general counsel for the International Ladies' Garment Workers'
               Union from 1913 to 1933 and was a leader in the Socialist Party from 1901 until his
               death in 1933. </div>
            <div class="para"> Morris Hillquit was one of the men most influential in molding the American socialist
               movement in the twentieth century. He enjoyed an international reputation as the foremost
               spokesman and theoretician of the Socialist Party of America from the party's founding
               in 1900 until his death in 1933. A social Democrat throughout his career, Hillquit
               believed in the American political process, the trade-union movement, and the brotherhood
               of all workers. He was the leader of the centrist position in the Socialist Party
               and, as author, politician, and labor attorney, he attempted to adapt abstract socialist
               doctrine to the problems of the American working class. </div>
            <div class="para"> A cultured, charming, and urbane man, Hillquit was at home in all worlds. He was
               a collector of art and a devotee of literature, the theater, and opera. He had a successful
               and lucrative New York City law practice apart from his legal work for the Socialist
               Party and the trade unions. His proficiency with languiges, his strict integrity,
               and his gift of empathy enabled him to work effectively in the international socialist
               movement as well as on the American scene. Gentle humor and quick, sharp wit marked
               his courtroom debates, his speeches, and his writings. An optimistic man whose intelligence
               and insight rarely led him to discouragement and never to despair, he believed in
               man and in socialism, and in the eventual triumph of both. </div>
            <div class="para"> Born on August 1, 1869, in Riga, Russia, Moses Hillkowitz was the third of five children
               of Benjamin and Rebecca (Levene) Hillkowitz. (He legally changed his name after he
               immigrated to the United States). Hillquit's mother tongue was German, as was his
               earliest education. From 1881 to 1886, however, he attended the Alexander Gymnasium,
               the only Russian school in Riga. In the latter year, because of pogroms in Russia,
               the Hillquit family immigrated to the United States and settled in New York City's
               lower East Side, a neighborhood largely inhabited by Eastern European emigres. </div>
            <div class="para"> Although his parents had decided that Hillquit would complete his education in the
               New York City public schools, he determined not to be "the drone of the family," and
               after a few months he quit school and sought a job. For a short time he worked in
               a shirt factory, later in a waist factory, and after that in a picture-frame factory.
               The deplorable working conditions and low wages in these sweatshops combined with
               the after-work discussions of social philosophies on the Cherry Street tenement roofs
               influenced his later career as a socialist leader and labor attorney. </div>
            <div class="para"> From his initial intellectual encounters in America, Hillquit allied himself with
               the Social Democrats and in 1887, when he reached the minimum membership age of eighteen,
               he joined the Socialist Labor Party. The following year he began his life-long association
               with the labor-union movement as one of the founders of the United Hebrew Trades.
               As the union's first corresponding secretary, he helped to organize, with varying
               degrees of success, the shirtmakers, the knee-pants makers, and the Jewish bakers
               of New York City. </div>
            <div class="para"> In 1889, Hillquit obtained his first political job, a four-dollar-a-week clerkship
               with the New York Labor News Company, a division of the Socialist Labor Party national
               office. The following year, with Abraham Cahan and Louis E. Miller, he helped to organize
               a Yiddish weekly, the Arbeiter Zeitung, and he joined the newspaper staff as "associate
               editor, business manager, bookkeeper, and official poet." Meanwhile, he mastered English
               and began teaching the language to immigrants in public school night classes. In 1891
               he entered the law school of the University of the City of New York, and upon graduation
               in 1893 he was admitted to the New York bar. In December of the latter year, he married
               his cousin and law-school classmate, Vera Levene. The Hillquits had three children:
               Nina Eugenia, Lawrence Benjamin, and Walter Benno. The latter died in infancy. </div>
            <div class="para"> From the time of his admission to the bar until the turn of the century, Hillquit
               was absorbed mainly in the establishment of his East Side law practice. He remained
               active in Socialist Labor Party politics, but grew increasingly dissatisfied with
               the tactics of party leader Daniel De Leon. In 1899, this dissatisfaction culminated
               in open opposition. Hillquit, with Max S. Hayes and Job Harriman, organized the anti-De
               Leon forces and sought control of the party. In the ensuing court battles, the De
               Leon supporters won the titles to party name and property. Subsequently, the unsuccessful
               insurgents opened fusion negotiations with the Social Democratic Party, and in 1901
               the two groups merged to form the Socialist Party of America. </div>
            <div class="para"> After the birth of the Socialist Party and until the outbreak of World War I, Hillquit
               devoted his time to the creation of a distinctly American socialist literature, the
               dissemination of socialist propaganda, and the education of American socialists. In
               addition to writing numerous pamphlets and articles, he published three books: History
               of Socialism in the United States (1903), Socialistm in Theory and Practice (1909),
               and Socialism Summed Up (1913). He established a reputation as an effective, popular
               orator and debater; two of his notable debates appeared in book form in 1914: Socialism,
               Promise or Menace?, a debate with Father John A. Ryan reprinted from Everybody's Magazine,
               and The Double Edge of Labor's Sword, the testimony of Hillquit, Samuel Gompers, and
               Max S. Hayes before the United States Commission on Industrial Relations. </div>
            <div class="para"> Convinced that the Socialist Party needed a training center for the study of socialist
               philosophy and propaganda methods, Hillquit and other party leaders organized the
               Rand School of Social Science in 1905, Hillquit served the school as a director and
               trustee until his death. He was a member of the board of directors of the Intercollegiate
               Socialist Society from its founding in 1905 until 1915. During the same time he served
               as international secretary of the Socialist Party and, in that capacity, he represented
               the party at three International Congresses: Amsterdam, 1904; Stuttgart, 1907; and
               Copenhagen, 1910. </div>
            <div class="para"> In addition to running for numerous minor political offices, twice before the war,
               in 1906 and 1908, Hillquit was the Socialist Party nominee for the New York Ninth
               District congressional seat. He lost both elections to a fusion candidate. </div>
            <div class="para"> Hillquit's legal ability aided the socialist and labor movements as effectively as
               his pen. He acted as principal legal advisor for the Socialist Party. He counseled
               Schenectady Mayor George R. Lunn's socialist government, and advised Santeri Nuorteva,
               representative of the Finnish Socialist Government in the United States. The majority
               of his legal cases were routine, but in 1901 he defended anarchist leader and editor
               Johann Most against charges of endangering the public peace. </div>
            <div class="para"> Before the war Hillquit aided two major strikes in the New York garment industry:
               the waistmakers' in 1909 and the cloackmakers' in 1910. In 1909 he was arbitrator
               for the Ladies Shirt Waist Makers' Union and in 1910, as representative of the New
               York Joint Board of Cloak and Skirt Makers' Unions, he became a member of the first
               Board of Arbitration esteblished under the "Protocol of Peace." Five years later,
               he successfully defended eight leaders and members of the Cloakmakers' Union, men
               who had composed the 1910 picket committee, against murder charges. He replaced Meyer
               London as counsel for the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union in 1914; until
               his death in 1933 he fought the union's legal battles and often intervened with diplomacy
               to settle disputes between the union membership and leadership. </div>
            <div class="para"> When war began in 1914, Hillquit's activities focused on opposition to the war and
               efforts to prevent American intervention. In December, 1914, he helped to organize
               the League to Limit Armaments. The following May, at the request of the National Executive
               Committee of the American Socialist Party, he drafted a manifesto analyzing the causes
               of the war, explaining socialist opposition, and outlining a peace program. He visited
               President Woodrow Wilson and urged him to support the Socialist Party's peace program.
               </div>
            <div class="para"> On April 7, 1917, the day after the American declaration of war, delegates overwhelmingly
               adopted an anti-war manifesto drafted by Hillquit, Algernon Lee, and Charles E. Ruthenberg.
               Despite American intervention, Hillquit continued to oppose the war and to work for
               peace. In May, 1917, he helped to arrange the first American Conference for Democracy
               and Terms of Peace. Three times during the war he was a candidate for public office.
               In 1916, he campaigned for the New York Twentieth District congressional seat and
               failed of election by only 350 votes. In 1917, when war hysteria was at its height,
               the party nominated him as the New York City mayoralty candidate. Although the opposition
               labeled him a traitor and an agent of the Kaiser, Hillquit boldly campaigned on a
               peace platform and in a four-way race polled 22 per cent of the total vote. In 1918,
               although seriously ill with tuberculosis and unable to campaign, Hillquit again ran
               for Congress from the Twentieth District. He lost the election but received mor than
               40 per cent of the vote. </div>
            <div class="para"> The entrance of America into the war and the passage of the Espionage Act brought
               hundreds of indictments against socialists and socialist publications. Hillquit defended
               the American Socialist, Pearson's Magazine, and the New York Call when the Post Office
               Department detained selected issues of the publications and ordered the publishers
               to show cause why their second-class mailing privileges should not be withdrawn. He
               was chief defense counsel in the Masses trial and was scheduled to defend Victor L.
               Berger, Eugene V. Debs, Scott Nearing, and a host of other socialists, when pulmonary
               tuberculosis forced his withdrawal from the cases. Nevertheless, during his confinement
               from the summer of 1918 until the summer of 1920, he continued to work for the party.
               When the success of the Russian Revolution created internal dissension over the question
               of party tactics, he wrote articles, drafted manifestoes, and revised Socialism Summed
               Up as Present Day Socialism (1920). The following year, he examined Marxist philosophy
               as applied by the Bolsheviks in From Marx to Lenin (1921). </div>
            <div class="para"> In January, 1920, Hillquit temporarily returned to professional life to be the chief
               defense counsel in the celebrated expulsion trial of five New York assemblymen who
               were members of the Socialist Party. Later that year, he published his closing defense
               counsel in the celebrated expulsion trial of five New York assemblymen who were members
               of the Socialist Party. Later that year, he published his closing defense argument
               in the trial as Socialism on Trial and ran for Congress from New York's Twentieth
               District. </div>
            <div class="para"> In another well-known postwar case, Schlesinger v. Quinto (1922), Hillquit established
               a legal precedent. As counsel for the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union
               and the New York Joint Board of Cloak Makers' Unions, he obtained an injunction restraining
               employers from violating contractual obligations. </div>
            <div class="para"> After the war, Hillquit, as international secretary of the Socialist Party, attempted
               to re-establish international ties that had been broken or weakened by the war. In
               1920, he proposed a resolution that recommended postponement of Socialist Party affiliation
               with either the Second or the Third International. The Socialist Party convention
               adopted the resolution, but a party referendum directed the National Executive Committee
               to apply for membership in the Third International even though the Communist had issued
               the Twenty-one Points, one of which denounced Hillquit and other internationally known
               Social Democrats as "reformists" and "notorious opportunists" and demanded their expulsion
               as a condition of membership. The Communists denied the application and subsequently
               the Socialist Party joined the Labour and Socialist International. During the next
               decade, Hillquit frequently traveled to Europe to participate in International Congresses
               and meet with European socialist leaders. </div>
            <div class="para"> In 1922, Hillquit and other Socialist Party leaders who were interested in the formation
               of an independent labor party attended the Chicago meetings of progressives that organized
               the Conference for Progressive Political Action. During the following two years, Hillquit
               was very active in fusion politics. He helped to write the constitution and served
               on the national committee of the Conference. When the Conference endorsed presidential
               candidate Robert M. La Follette in 1924, the Socialist Party supported the nominee
               and Hillquit actively campaigned for the ticket. However, after La Follette's defeat,
               the Conference for Progressive Political Action disbanded; and the socialists, under
               Hillquit's leadership, declined to participate in other liberal coalitions and began
               to rebuild the party. </div>
            <div class="para"> Hillquit became national chairman of the Socialist Party in 1929. At the 1932 national
               convention a faction attempted to replace him with Daniel W. Hoan, the socialist mayor
               of Milwaukee. Hillquit won re-election and later that year ran his final political
               race as a candidate for mayor of New York City. A strenuous campaign brought him 250,000
               votes, but undermined his failing health. </div>
            <div class="para"> Despite illness he continued to work for labor and socialism. He drafted a code for
               the coat and suit industry and defended it before the National Industrial Recovery
               hearings in Washington. He also completed his autobiography, Loose Leaves From a Busy
               Life, which was published posthumously in 1934. </div>
            <div class="para"> Hillquit died on October 7, 1933. The condolence letters and telegrams that deluged
               his family, and the funeral procession of socialists and working-class people that
               filled the New York streets, measured in a small way his achievements as a socialist
               and labor leader.</div>  </a>
