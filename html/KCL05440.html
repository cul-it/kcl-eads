               of the Industrial Workers of the World, the first major American industrial and syndicalist
               union. </div>
            <div class="para"> Brissenden (Ph.D. Columbia University) served as a special investigator for the US
               Bureau of Labor Statistics (1915-1920), taught labor economics and history at New
               York University (1920-1921) and at Columbia University, where he remained until his
               retirement. In addition to a number of publications in labor economics, Professor
               Brissenden wrote two major histories of the Industrial Workers of the World.</div>  </a>

            <div class="para">Established in Chicago, 1905, by sponsors of socialism and the remnants of radical
               labor unions, including the Knights of Labor, Western Federation of Miners and the
               American Labor Union, the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) or "Wobblies", evolved
               into a radical industrial union which waged campaigns for improved working conditions,
               wages and hours of work, as well as workers' control in mines, mills, lumber camps
               and factories.</div>  </a>
         
         <hr><a name="a3">
            
            
            <div class="para">Consists chiefly of incoming letters, newspaper and journal articles and clippings,
               documents, and notes of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) from its founding
               in 1905 to 1928. The bulk of the information derived from these sources was used by
               Brissenden in researching a book he was at the time engaged in writing (eventually
               published as THE IWW; A STUDY OF AMERICAN SYNDICALISM). General topics covered by
               the collection include the membership of the IWW; the structure of the union, particularly
               with reference to locals; theories of syndicalism and "direct action"; free speech
               fights in varoius cities; and the criminal syndicalism and sabotage acts passed by
               various states in tye years 1917-1919. Also included are numerous drafts of portions
               of the book. </div>
            <div class="para"> Specifically, the collection includes letters to Brissenden from Archie Robertson,
               IWW organizer, criticizing the title of Brissenden's book and taking exception to
               Brissenden's description of the IWW as syndicalist (1922); E. Pfister (Socialist Labor
               Party) requesting copies of Brissenden's book to be used in an unnamed trial (1922);
               Vincent St. John giving estimates, by year, of IWW membership, number of local charters
               granted, number of locals disbanding, and distribution of membership by industry (1915);
               Sidney Osborne (Arizona secretary of state) informing Brissenden that a state sabotage
               law had been vetoed by Governer Lister (1918); and William D. Haywood from Moscow,
               Russia, answering in detail Brissenden's queries about the history of the Western
               Federation of Miners and giving locations of documents relating to that organization
               (1923). Also, letter of William D. Haywood to C. McCarty (US Commission on Industrial
               Relations) regarding free speech fights in Kansas City, Kans., Los Angeles, Calif.,
               Aberdeen, S.D., Denver, Colo., and Minot, N.D. </div>
            <div class="para"> Also included in the collection are numerous copies of anti-syndicalist and anti-sabotage
               legislation from various states. Included, as well, are numerous newspaper and article
               clippings on anti-syndicalist legislation. </div>
            <div class="para"> In addition, collection includes copies of IWW convention proceedings and constitutions;
               essays by Brissenden on a variety of topics, including amnesty for IWW members convicted
               under anti-syndicalism laws, the IWW attitude toward the state, and the development
               of syndicalism in the IWW after 1909; and notes on many aspects of the development
               of the IWW and American radicalism, including comments on the formation of the United
               Harbor and Marine Workers of America, on the splits and differences among the left-wing
               parties in America, on Elizabeth Gurley Flynn's attitude toward William Haywood's
               leaving for Russia (1921), on the attitude of the IWW toward Soviet Russia (specifically
               the Red Traade Union International, 1921), on strikes conducted by the IWW, and syndicalism
               in Germany, France, and Italy. </div>
            <div class="para"> Finally, copies of a notice served on behalf of the Durst Brothers to the County
               Boards of Directors of Yuma, Sutter, and Placer counties, declaring an imminent threat
               to property in those counties as a result of a proposed strike by IWW agricultural
               workers (1914); a copy of demands made by strikers at the Stone and Webster Construction
               Company in Big Creek (1913); and a questionnaire on conditions in logging camps (n.d.),
               among other documents. </div>
