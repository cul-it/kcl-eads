            <div class="para">The Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), proposed by John L. Lewis in 1928,
               was a federation of unions that organized workers in industrial unions in the United
               States and Canada from 1935 to 1955. The Committee for Industrial Organization was
               formed by the presidents of eight international unions in 1935. The presidents of
               these unions were dissatisfied with the American Federation of Labor's unwillingness
               to commit itself to a program of organizing industrial unions. In 1936, the A.F. of
               L. suspended the ten unions which proceeded to organize an independent federation,
               the Congress of Industrial Organizations. The CIO subsequently became the A.F. of
               L.'s chief rival for the leadership of American unions. The groups were reunited in
               1955 as the AFL-CIO.</div>  </a>
