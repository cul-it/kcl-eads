            relating to a case argued before both the Nebraska State Supreme Court and the United
            States Supreme Court. This was a case designed to determine the constitutionality
            of the union shop provision of the Railway Labor Act. The union shop provision was
            amended to the act in 1951 [Section 2, Eleventh]. The case was argued before the Nebraska
            Supreme Court in July 1955, and in front of the United States Supreme Court in October
            1955 [No. 451].</div>

            <div class="para">The Railway Labor Act [RLA], which applies to employees of interstate rail and air
               carriers, was amended in 1951 to add a union shop provision [Section 2, Eleventh].
               Prior to 1951, the RLA did not have this clause, but rather specified that union membership
               could not be a requirement to employment nor were union-dues check-offs allowed. This
               was to curb the possibility of company controlled labor organizations serving as bargaining
               agents with themselves at the expense of the employees. By 1951, these company dominated
               unions were no longer a factor, and after lobbying by railroad labor groups, the above
               mentioned amendment was added to the RLA, empowering unions to enter into union shop
               agreements with railroad carriers. The amendment to the RLA reads, in part, that labor
               organizations "shall be permitted...to make agreements, requiring, as a condition
               of continued employment, that within 60 days the beginning of such employment all
               employees shall become members of the labor organization representing their craft
               or class" [Section 2, Eleventh (a)]. In addition to allowing the union shop, the amendment
               also explicitly stated that this amendment superseded any laws or statutes passed
               at the local or state level. However, the amendment did not repeal the prior injunction
               against union shop; it merely superseded it. This is in contrast to the Taft-Hartley
               Act, which allows individual states to impose more stringent measures against unions.
               At the time of the amendment to the RLA, there were eighteen states with right to
               work laws that outlawed union shop agreements; eleven of these were in the South.
               </div>
            <div class="para"> In 1953, Union Pacific Railroad Company [UP] entered into a union shop agreement
               with sixteen labor unions. The plaintiffs, Robert L. Hanson and other non-union employees
               of UP, sued the company and the labor unions in a district court in Nebraska to halt
               the union shop agreement because Nebraska has a right to work clause in its state
               constitution. The plaintiffs argued that in addition to being unconstitutional under
               the state constitution, they would suffer irreperable injury by being forced to pay
               dues, fees, and assessments to an organization they were being compelled to join.
               Conversely, the unions argued that these employees, dubbed "free riders," enjoyed
               all the benefits the unions achieved for employees through collective bargaining without
               paying their share of the costs of conducting those bargaining agreements. </div>
            <div class="para">  The district court judge issued the injunction and in 1954 found in favor of the
               plaintiffs. The unions appealed the case to the Supreme Court of Nebraska which, in
               an opinion written by Justice Adolph Wenke, upheld the lower court's decision. The
               labor unions then appealled the case to the United States Supreme Court. </div>
            <div class="para"> The United States Supreme Court found the union shop provision of the RLA constitutional.
               Justice Douglas wrote in his opinion, "We only hold that the requirement for financial
               support of the collective-bargaining agency by all who receive the benefits of its
               work is within the power of Congress under the Commerce Clause." </div>

               526 (1955)], fourteen amicus briefs filed with the United States Supreme Court by
               various enitities after the suit was successfully appealed, the brief Robert L. Hanson
               and his fellow individual appellees filed with the Supreme Court, and an article written
               by J. A. McClain, Jr., dean of the School of Law of Duke University on the ruling
               of the Supreme Court. </div>
            <div class="para"> The opinion of the Nebraska Supreme Court was written by Justice Adolph Wenke and
               found in favor of the plaintiffs. Amicus briefs were filed by other individuals opposed
               to union shops, organizations that supported right to work legislation, and individual
               American states and commonwealths that had right to work laws. The organizations represented
               in the amicus briefs are the American Farm Bureau Federation , the National Right
               to Work Committee, the National Association of Manufacturers, the Chamber of Commerce
               of the United States, and the Southern States Industrial Council. The states and commonwealths
