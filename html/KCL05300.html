            <div class="para">The RLEA was founded in 1926 in response to the passage of the Railway Labor Act.
               Prior to 1926, there had been an informal association between the railroad labor organizations
               so that the various chief executives of the different unions could work together to
               form a unified course of action that would benefit all of their members. This group
               became more formalized immediately after the end of World War I. The U.S. railroads
               had been nationalized as part of the war effort, and the railroad labor organizations
               wanted them to remain under federal management, both because of increased productivity
               and because of better labor relations with the industry. The effort was ultimately
               unsuccessful, and the railroads returned to private industry; however, the railroad
               labor organizations had realized the need to have a united front to counter the carriers
               and industry groups and lobbyists. </div>
            <div class="para"> On May 18, 1926, the chief executives of the railroad labor organization met in Washington
               D.C., formalized their association with By-Laws, and elected officers to serve the
               newly created RLEA. The original purpose, codified in the original preamble, was co-operative
               action to obtain and develop consistent interpretations and utilization of the Railway
               Labor Act. The RLEA was comprised of the chief executives of the 21 railroad labor
               unions, including the president of the Railway Employees' Department of the AFL, and
               each member got one vote, regardless of the size of their union. The organization
               was voluntary, so no member organization was bound by its decisions. Over the course
               of its existence, various member organizations withdrew and then re-affiliated with
               the RLEA. </div>
            <div class="para"> From 1926 to 1938, the RLEA did not maintain an office, but the amount of work and
               its importance led the RLEA to open an office in Washington DC and employ a full-time
               Executive Secretary-Treasurer to run it. The RLEA did not engage in collective bargaining
               itself, but rather lobbied on behalf of its member organizations, securing such achievements
               as the Railroad Retirement Act and limiting unemployment for its members during the
               Great Depression. The RLEA's various areas of interest, such as retirement, safety,
               legal matters, were broken down into committees, each of which reported back to the
               executive board on the steps being taken in those areas. </div>
            <div class="para"> Post World War II, the RLEA played a central role in the Marshall Plan, working with
               non-Communist labor organizations in Western Europe to establish labor policy and
               also assist in the work of rebuilding the European railroads. The RLEA was also a
               major factor in international labor union federations, and its decision to affiliate
               with the International Transport Workers' Federation [ITWF] and to encourage the ITWF
               not to join with the Soviet affiliated World Federation of Trade Unions was seen as
               a major victory for the west. </div>
            <div class="para"> The RLEA, like its member organizations, did not allow African-American members.
               As such, it was only representing the interests of white railroad employees; black
               railroad employees were forced, for the most part, to work without recognized union
               protection. The exception to this was the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters [BSCP],
               who in 1948 began a series of successful legal challenges to the jurisdictions over
               various classes of work. As BSCP's successes in the courts mounted up, and the RLEA's
               member unions and the RLEA itself were being sued for discriminatory practices, the
               RLEA finally capitulated in 1950, and accepted the BSCP as a member organization.
               </div>
            <div class="para"> In 1950, the RLEA joined with the AFL, CIO, and International Association of Machinists
               to form the United Labor Policy Committee. This committee oversaw the labor representatives
               of the Wage Stabilization Board. </div>
            <div class="para"> In the latter half of the 20th century, the importance of the RLEA declined alongside
               the decline in the railroad industry itself. As its member unions either merged into
               single entities or disaffiliated from the RLEA its influence waned, as did the number
               of its members. The RLEA attempted to counter this decline with the purchase of a
               railroad at least three different times in the 1970s and 1980s, though they were ultimately
               unsuccessful in this venture. Ongoing internal battles between the remaining chief
               executives of the railroad unions further weakened the RLEA until in 1997 it disbanded,
               handing over its responsibilities to the newly formed AFL-CIO Transportation Trades
               Department.</div>  </a>

            <div class="para"> This collection consists of miscellaneous records from the Railway Labor Executives'
               Association. The majority of the records found in this collection deal with the issues
               faced by railroad labor in the 1950s and 1960s when the major carriers began to merge
               and to abandon lines. The applications of the carriers to the Interstate Commerce
               Committee [ICC] are documented in the Finance Docket filings. Also of note are the
               speeches by various railroad labor chief executives in which they speak out against
               the mergers because of the effect they would have on the nation's economy and on local
               communities whose tax bases depended on the railroad industry. This collection also
               contains drafts of a study commissioned by the RLEA about railroad mergers. Also found
               are public relations materials from the RLEA addressing the mergers as well as pushing
               back against accusations of featherbedding by the carriers. Finally, the correspondence
               files contain bulletins and circulars issued by the RLEA about various cases that
               effect the employees represented by their member unions.</div>  </a>
