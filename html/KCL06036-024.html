            <div class="para">Founded in 1900 by local union delegates representing about 2,000 members in cities
               in the northeastern United States, the ILGWU grew in geographical scope, membership
               size, political influence to become one of the most powerful forces in American organized
               labor by mid-century. Representing workers in the women's garment industry, the ILGWU
               worked to improve working and living conditions of its members through collective
               bargaining agreements, training programs, health care facilities, cooperative housing,
               educational opportunities, and other efforts. In 1995, the ILGWU merged with the Amalgamated
               Clothing and Textile Workers Union (ACTWU) to form the Union of Needletrades, Industrial
               and Textile Employees (UNITE).</div>  </a>

            <div class="para">Maida Springer Kemp was born on May 12, 1910 in Panama and moved to New York City
               at the age of seven with her mother. After receiving an education in where she attended
               a black boarding school, Kemp became a licensed beautician, though never worked in
               that trade. Her earliest experience in the garment industry was when she worked as
               a pinker while in school. Because of the Depression, in 1932 as a young wife with
               a small child, Kemp became employed as a finisher doing hand sewing in a garment shop
               and joined the ILGWU. During the 1933 general strike, she was a member of a strike
               committee. She continued to work in the shop for the next eight years and became very
               active in the union. Kemp held various roles in Local 22 of the Dressmakers' Union,
               including executive board member, chairman of the education committee and shop representative.
               In 1942, Kemp became union staff and was appointed education director of Local 132,
               the Plastic Button and Novelty Workers' Union (an accessory local of the ILGWU) focusing
               on educating the new membership that consisted of refugees, recently released prisoners,
               women and minorities. </div>
            <div class="para"> Kemp became the first black business agent of ILGWU Local 22 in 1947 and held that
               position for thirteen years. As a business agent, she was often sent out as a representative
               or attended educational programs. Kemp developed international interests and studied
               and traveled to increase her knowledge of the world labor movement. She received an
               American Scandinavian Foundation scholarship to study workers' education in Sweden
               and Denmark and through an Urban League fellowship studied at Ruskin College at Oxford.
               </div>
            <div class="para"> During her tenure with the ILGWU, Kemp devoted time to other organizations as well.
               She often worked on projects for A. Philip Randolph, such as helping with a City Council
               campaign and putting on a rally in Madison Square Garden for the Fair Employment Practices
               Commission. Kemp became the first black woman to represent American labor abroad when
               the AFL sent her to England in 1945. </div>
            <div class="para"> In 1955, Kemp was sent as an AFL representative to an International Confederation
               of Free Trade Unions conference in Africa for a three week seminar. Inspired, Kemp
               soon became tireless in her work in Africa. She developed training programs for workers,
               secured funds for constructing trade union centers such as the Solidarity House in
               Nairobi, and educating the leadership of the African labor movement. Her extensive
               travel to Africa prompted her to intermittently live in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. </div>
            <div class="para"> Kemp received many awards and honors during her lifetime and was a member of numerous
               organizations including the NAACP, National Organization of Women (NOW), the Coalition
               of Labor Union Women (CLUW), the National Council of Negro Women, and the Urban League.
               Kemp died on March 29, 2005 at the age of 94.</div>  </a>

            <div class="para">The collection contains the bound oral history of Maida Springer Kemp. The interview
               was conducted by Elizabeth Balanoff as part of the oral history project "The 20th
               Century Trade Union Women: Vehicle for Social Change" in cooperation with "The Black
               Women Oral History Project" of the Schlesinger Library at Radcliffe College. The oral
               history took place over the course of multiple interviews beginning on January 4,
               1977. Kemp discusses her family background and early history of coming from Panama
               and the alienation of being both a foreigner and black. She comments on the closeness
               with her mother and their introduction into America and its culture, and early influences,
               especially in the black community. </div>
            <div class="para"> Kemp recounts her early work history and how she became involved with the ILGWU,
               her activism and participation within the union and the various positions she held
               and roles she played. She focuses on the importance of social issues of the union
               including health and education. Kemp also touches on subjects such as racial and sex
               discrimination. Contacts and acquaintances of the women from other unions and labor,
               including Pauline Newman and Rose Schneiderman are mentioned. </div>
            <div class="para"> Her work outside the ILGWU is examined, including the early trips overseas for the
               AFL, and projects with A. Philip Randolph. Much emphasis in the interview is placed
               on Kemp's international efforts, especially Africa. Discussed is the labor movement
               in Africa and the support and organization by American labor in those efforts, the
               importance of workers' education, the progress made in educating the leadership of
               the African labor movement, and the building and organizing of trade union centers,
               mainly Solidarity House in Nairobi. </div>
            <div class="para"> Kemp provides her personal thoughts on the women's movement, she states that she
               is a supporter but not an activist, and believes it is misunderstood in a similar
               way as the labor movement. The interviewer asks Kemp what she would have told or done
               if she had a daughter, and the conversation turns to advice for young women regarding
               education, career, sex and marriage. Other topics discussed in detail include Kemp's
               involvement in organizations such as the NAACP and the Urban League.</div>  </a>
