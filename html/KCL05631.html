            <div class="para">The Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen was founded in 1883 in Oneonta, N.Y. as a protective
               and insurance organization. By the time of its merger with three other railroad labor
               unions to form the United Transportation Union in 1969, it had the greatest membership
               of any of the operating railroad brotherhoods. </div>
            <div class="para"> The Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen (BRT) was established to represent members'
               interests in obtaining a satisfactory contract with management. The first Canadian
               lodge was established in Moncton, New Brunswick in 1885, and the first Ladies' Auxiliary
               was organized in Fort Gratiot, Mich. in 1889. These records reflect the union's political
               and fraternal activities as well as its actions in the areas of collective bargaining,
               grievances, and railroad and labor legislation. As the largest of the unions which
               merged to form the United Transportation Union in 1969, the bulk of its then current
               files formed the basis for the files now held in the merged union's headquarters.
               </div>
            <div class="para"> The rail service members of the BRT included conductors and their assistants, dining
               car stewards, ticket collectors, train baggagemen, brakemen, and train flagmen. The
               yard service members of the BRT included yardmasters, yard conductors, switchtenders,
               foremen, flagmen, brakemen, switchmen, car tenders, operators, hump riders, and car
               operators. In 1933, the BRT organized interstate bus operators, and included them
               under BRT contracts held with U.S. bus companies. </div>
            <div class="para"> BRT officers were elected at the Grand Lodge Convention of the Brotherhood, held
               every 4 years. The principal officers included a president, an assistant to the president,
               a general secretary-treasurer, Canadian and national legislative representatives,
               a senior vice-president, BRT representative, and National Railroad Board of Adjustment
               representative. The BRT had four governing boards: the Board of Directors, Board of
               Trustees and Insurance, Board of Appeals, and Executive Board.</div>  </a>
