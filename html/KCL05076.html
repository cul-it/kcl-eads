            <div class="para">The Railroad Marine Workers Commission was appointed March 24, 1961 by the President
               under his general powers to make re-ccrrjnendation;-, concerning the dispute over
               manning requirements aboard railroad owned tug boats and ferries in New York harbor.
               </div>
            <div class="para"> The dispute began in 1959 over changes in the collective bargain-ing agreement and
               covered a wide range of wage, fringe benefits and rules changes. Emergency Board Number
               133 was appointed, and made a number of recommendations with respect to the issues
               in dispute. On the matter of the resolution of controversies involving the elimination
               of positions or of classifications of work it suggested a 60 day notice during which
               time the parties could negotiate on the changes. </div>
            <div class="para"> Negotiations were unsuccessful and on January 10,1961 a work stoppage was put into
               effect. On January 23, 1961 the parties accepted a joint recommendation of the U.S.
               Secretary of Labor, the Governor of New York State and the Mayor of Mew York City.
               It orovided for the reconstitution of the Presidential Hail-road Commission 60 days
               after it had submitted its findings in the dispute involving the railroad brotherhoods
               and the major U.S. railroads. </div>
            <div class="para"> The members of the Railroad Marine Workers Commission were formally appointed by
               the President on February 9, 1962. The public members were Isador Lubin, chairman,
               Lloyd H. Bailer and Vernon H. Jensen. L.B. Fee, J.J. Gaherin ana J.H. Maher represented
