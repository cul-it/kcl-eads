               Railroad in Wisconsin, extended the lines and later, after the financial troubles
               of 1857, reorganized the line into the Chicago and North Western Railway, into which
               the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad was also merged.</div>  </a>

            <p></p>
            
            <div class="para">The Chicago and North Western Transportation Company [CNW] was a Class I railroad
               in the Midwestern United States, often called the North Western. The CNW also called
               itself the "Pioneer Railroad," because one of its predecessor lines, the Galena and
               Chicago Union Railroad, was the first railroad to run out of Chicago. The railroad
               operated more than 12,000 miles of track in seven states (Wisconsin, Iowa, Nebraska,
               South Dakota, Illinois, Missouri, and Michigan) before retrenchment in the late 1970s.
               At the height of the railroad era, the CNW was one of the most profitable of the Midwestern
               railroads and one of the longest railroads in the United States because of mergers
               with other railroads, such as the Chicago Great Western Railway, Minneapolis and St.
               Louis Railway and others. </div>
            <div class="para"> The CNW's earliest predecessor, the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad [GCU], was
               chartered in 1836. In 1848, it operated the first steam locomotive out of Chicago.
               Despite this early success, the GCU had many problems, including an inability to build
               tracks to Galena, Illinois, one of its supposed terminals, and instead had to rely
               on an interchange built by the Illinois Central to reach the city. These problems
               led to it being purchased by William Butler Ogden. Ogden was the first mayor of Chicago
               and a railroad investor. Ogden had already taken over the Madison and Beloit Railroad
               in Wisconsin and extended its lines. After the financial trouble of 1857, Ogden founded
               and incorporated the CNW. The CNW was chartered on June 7, 1859, by the legislatures
               of Illinois and Wisconsin. Five days previously, it had purchased the bankrupt Chicago,
               St. Paul and Fond du Lac Railroad. Ogden now controlled numerous roads in the Midwest;
               by 1865, they were merged into one system, the CNW, with over 850 miles of track.
               Ogden left the company in 1868 and became president of the Union Pacific. This was
               after one of CNW's predecessor lines, the Cedar Rapids and Missouri River Rail Road,
               had reached Council Bluffs, Iowa, in 1867, establishing a direct interchange with
               the Union Pacific, the first transcontinental railroad. By the end of the 19th Century,
               the CNW operated on over 7,000 miles of track, connecting such cities as Chicago,
               Omaha, Milwaukee, Duluth, Rapid City and the Twin Cities. </div>
            <div class="para"> The CNW opened its Proviso Yards in Chicago in 1929. This facility was the largest
               of its kind when it was built, containing 224 miles of tracks and a huge diesel shop.
               The CNW was a "granger" railroad, primarily serving agricultural businesses. Potatoes
               were ones of its main crops, and the Potato Sheds in its Wood Street Yards were the
               largest in the world. It also did extensive business in transporting sugar beets,
               corn and wheat. The CNW also operated extensive passenger lines, including serving
               as one of the main commuter lines for Chicago. </div>
            <div class="para"> The CNW was unique among American railroads in that it ran on a left-hand main, which
               meant that traffic was routed to the left instead of to the right. This was common
               among railroads built by British companies, but not among American ones. </div>
            <div class="para"> The CNW was badly affected by the Great Depression, declaring bankruptcy in 1935
               and not emerging until 1944 with the surge in traffic that happened because of the
               mobilization of men and goods for World War II. </div>
            <div class="para"> The post-war period saw another sharp decline in the CNW's profits, as freight increasingly
               moved to the highways and the CNW had a large amount of secondary trackage that was
               a massive drain on the company since the industries on these lines no longer used
               the rails to ship their goods. However, even with this reality, the CNW still made
               major acquisitions in the late 1950s and 1960s, gaining control of the Litchfield
               and Madison Railway in 1958, the Minneapolis and St. Louis Railway in 1960, and the
               Chicago Great Western Railway in 1968. </div>
            <div class="para"> In 1972, the CNW was sold to its employees and renamed the Chicago and North Western
               Transportation Company. In 1985, the employee owned stock of the company was transferred
               to the newly formed CNW Corporation, ending the employee owned period. By 1995, track
               sales and abandonment had reduced the total mileage of the CNW to about 5,000 miles.
               The company was purchased by Union Pacific [UP] in April 1995 and ceased to exist
               as an independent entity.</div>  </a>

                        of the previously mentioned agreements. Some of the circulars have attached correspondence,

                     <div class="para">The National Railroad Adjustment Board [NRAB] was created by 45 U.S. Code 153, part
                        of the Railway Labor Act. It is overseen by the National Mediation Board, which was
                        created by the 1934 amendment to Railway Labor Act to oversee the arbitration of labor
                        disputes in the railway and airline industries. The NRAB is tasked with arbitrating
                        minor disputes, i.e. grievance arbitrations, in the railway industry. This series
                        contains the NRAB's decision in cases that either affected labor relations on the
                        M&amp;St.L system, or cases that directly involved M&amp;St.L personnel. The latter are all
                        cases of employees' claims for wages, filed by the Switchmen's Union of North America
                        [SUNA].</div>

                        during the 1950s and 1960s; this period is sometimes referred to Railroad Merger Era.
                        It began in the late 1950s with the approval of the merger between the Norfolk and
                        Western with The Virginian Railway. The culmination of the railroad merger era was
                        the merger of the Pennsylvania Railroad with the New York Central Railroad in 1968,
                        forming the Penn Central Transportation Company. </div>
                     <div class="para">  This series contains some of the Agreements of the Penn Central merger, as well
                        as copies of Agreements from other large carrier mergers. These records are present
                        because they were used as templates for the Agreements used in CNW's merger with Chicago
                        Great Western Railway in 1968. The various Consolidation Agreements demonstrate how
                        complicated and unwieldy this process was, and helps demonstrate why the majority
                        of these mergers resulted in larger carrier companies declaring bankruptcy and led
                        to the deregulation of the industry and the creation of national corporations ConRail
                        and Amtrak which operated on what had been the Penn Central's tracks.</div>

                        records come from the Rules Movement of 1958, but other years are represented. The
                        National Rules Movement were efforts by the railroad labor organizations to change
                        operating rules for railroad employees. The Rules Movement of 1950 was concerned with
                        moving to a 40-Hour week from a 48-Hour week with no reduction in pay. The 1958 Rules
                        Movement was concerned with the operation of rules establishing time limits for the
                        handling of claims and grievances; hiring practices; safety, health, and sanitation;
                        and, accidents. Other issues addressed in Rules Movements of 1958 include vacation
                        and holiday agreements. </div>

                     <div class="para">This series contains records of the local agreements the M&amp;St.L had with various railroad
                        labor organizations. Also included are reports of conferences between the local representatives
                        of the labor organizations and the M&amp;St.L representatives. These agreements are interesting
                        because of their focus on smaller and more local concerns that are not always represented
                        in the national agreements. Many of these records are about the M&amp;St.L facility on
                        Fort Dodge, Iowa. Of particular interest are the blue prints for a proposed office
                        building, maps of the train yards, and an attempt by the M&amp;St.L to rent space from
                        the Illinois Central Railroad to defray the costs of maintaining their own facilities.
                        </div>
                     <div class="para">  Also located in this series is a folder containing articles and essays on the issue
                        of featherbedding. Featherbedding is the practice of hiring more workers than are
                        needed to perform a given job. The term is often used by management to refer to labor
                        union contracts which require them to keep a certain number of staff employed, even
                        in instances in which they are no longer needed, such as with the rise of automated
                        workflows that render certain positions obsolete. Certain local agreements are also
                        filed with theses clippings, presumably because the M&amp;St.L felt that these Agreements
                        were example of the same. </div>
                     <div class="para">  Of particular interest is a file regarding the use of Edifone Equipment to record
                        formal investigations. It is included in this series because it was a policy adopted
                        by the M&amp;St.L and agreed upon by the various locals. However, the introduction of
                        this equipment is indicative of the effects automation began to have on the work,
                        particularly with regard to the clerks and stenographers employed by the M&amp;St.L.</div>
