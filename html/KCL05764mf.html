            <div class="para">The American Bureau of Industrial Research (ABIR) was established in 1904 at the University
               of Wisconsin at Madison to collect primary historical materials on the American labor
               movement. </div>
            <div class="para"> John Samuel was appointed a Knights of Labor organizer in 1881, and three years later
               became a member of the Knight's Co-operative Board. By the early 1890's Samuel's formal
               connection with the Knights lapsed but his interest in cooperation continued. He became
               general secretary of the Co-Operative Union of the United States and Canada in 1894.
               </div>
            <div class="para"> In 1883, Joseph P. McDonnell was instrumental in organizing the New Jersey Federation
               of Trades and Labor Unions, on which he served as chairman for many years. He was
               also president of the American Federation of Labor in New Jersey. In 1892 McDonnell
               was appointed to the New Jersey Board of Arbitration, and later served as president
               of the Board. </div>
            <div class="para"> Albert R. Parsons, an anarchist and militant labor advocate, was one of four men
               executed following the 1886 Haymarket bombing in Chicago. </div>
            <div class="para"> Edward H. Rogers was a largely self-educated labor reformer, politician, and theologian.
               He helped found the Christian Labor Party in 1872. </div>
            <div class="para"> Ira Steward rose to leadership in the Machinist's and Blacksmiths' International
               Union during the Civil War and later became one of the most astute writers on American
               labor issues. In 1877 he helped to form the International Labor Union. </div>
            <div class="para"> Thomas Phillips was instrumental in founding the Union Co-operative Association and
               by 1869, he had become active in the Knights of St. Crispin. In the 1870's he served
               as an organizer in the Sovereigns of Industry and later in the Knights of Labor. In
               1889 he was elected national president of the Boot and Shoe Workers International
               Union. </div>
            <div class="para"> The Noble Order of the Knights of Labor was first organized in the Philadelphia garment
               industry in 1869. It constituted the most powerful force in American labor in the
               nineteenth century. It was the first national labor organization to extensively recruit
               women and blacks, to organize throughout the country, and to attempt to unify industrial
               and agrarian workers. </div>
            <div class="para"> The Sovereigns of Industry was a cooperative and fraternal order. Beginning as the
               Patrons of Industry, the organization was renamed as the Sovereigns in 1874.</div>  </a>
         
         <hr><a name="a3">
            
            
            <div class="para">Nearly all the Samuel papers concern cooperation in this country and in England, the
               Knights of Labor, and related topics. The collection consists of correspondence, notebooks
               and publications. </div>
            <div class="para"> The bulk of the McDonnell papers consist of annual reports of the New Jersey Federation
               of Trades and Labor Unions and a manuscript report of the New Jersey Board of Arbitration
               for 1893-1894. </div>
            <div class="para"> Nearly all of the Parsons papers document the trial for the murder of a policeman
               who died in the 1886 Haymarket bombing in Chicago. Included are correspondence, notes
               taken by Parsons during the trial, and a large volume of clippings and broadsides.
               </div>
            <div class="para"> The Rogers papers cover reform issues in education, labor, and religion and comprise
               four series: correspondence, autobiography, notebooks and pamphlets, and miscellaneous
               articles. </div>
            <div class="para"> The Steward papers center on the eight-hour movement and are divided in to four major
               series: typescripts of writings, manuscript bundles of writings, letters and Philadelphia
               Central Eight Hour League. </div>
            <div class="para"> The Phillips papers, including correspondence, account books and minutes, cover the
               principles and propects of cooperation and the workings of cooperative societies.
               </div>
            <div class="para"> The Knights of Labor papers contain three series: bound volumes, papers, and yearbooks.
               Topics include negotiation and arbitration with executives of companies and internal
               union affairs. </div>
            <div class="para"> The Sovereigns of Industry collection consists of six series: papers, bound volumes,
               correspondence, records of members, printed material and records. These include statistics
               on membership, financial records, etc. </div>
            <div class="para"> The documents in the Geisse and Huebner collection consist entirely of questionnaires
               and correspondence in answer to the question "Does the development of trade unionism
               in the U.S. during the last twenty years show the general tendency of that development
               to be in the aggregate, contrary to the best interests of the country?"</div>  </a>
