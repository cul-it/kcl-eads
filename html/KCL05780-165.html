            <div class="para">The International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union was once one of the largest labor
               unions in the United States founded in 1900 by local union delegates representing
               about 2,000 members in cities in the northeastern United States. It was one of the
               first U.S. Unions to have a membership consisting of mostly females, and it played
               a key role in the labor history of the 1920s and 1930s. The union is generally referred
               to as the "ILGWU" or the "ILG". The ILGWU grew in geographical scope, membership size,
               and political influence to become one of the most powerful forces in American organized
               labor by mid-century. Representing workers in the women's garment industry, the ILGWU
               worked to improve working and living conditions of its members through collective
               bargaining agreements, training programs, health care facilities, cooperative housing,
               educational opportunities, and other efforts. The ILGWU merged with the Amalgamated
               Clothing and Textile Workers Union in 1995 to form the Union of Needle trades, Industrial
               and Textile Employees (UNITE). UNITE merged with the Hotel Employees and Restaurant
               Employees Union (HERE) in 2004 to create a new union known as UNITE HERE. The two
               unions that formed UNITE in 1995 represented only 250,000 workers between them, down
               from the ILGWU's peak membership of 450,000 in 1969.</div>  </a>

            <p></p>
            
            <div class="para">Beginning in March 1924, the ILGWU and the Joint Board of Cloak and Dressmakers' Union
               began negotiations with the Merchants' Ladies' Garment Association (jobbers), the
               Cloak, Suit and Skirt Manufacturers' Protective Association (manufacturers), and the
               American Cloak and Suit Manufacturers' Association (sub-manufacturers). When no agreement
               could be reached by June 1924, New York Governor Alfred E. Smith appointed a Special
               Advisory Commission consisting of George Gordon Battle (Chairman), Herbert Lehman,
               Arthur Wolf, Lindsay Rogers, and Bernard Schientag (State Industrial Commissioner).
               Representing the union and associations were Morris Hillquit (ILGWU), Samuel Blumberg
               (Merchants' Ladies' Garment Association) and William Klein (Cloak and Suit Manufacturers'
               Protective Association). Public hearings took place between June 17 and June 25, and
               on June 27, recommendations were submitted. Accepted by the union, sub-manufacturers,
               and manufacturers, the jobbers refused until July 7, 1924 when the Merchants' Association
               agreed to the terms of the Governors' Commission.</div>  </a>

            <div class="para">The collection contains the typed transcripts from the hearings of the Special Commission
               appointed by Governor Smith to investigate and arbitrate the existing differences
               between the ILGWU and the associations of manufacturers and jobbers. Taking place
               at the office of the State Labor Department in New York City, the records contain
               hearings that date between July 15, 1924 and October 27, 1924. In the form of questions
               and answers between the Special Commission and the representatives of the ILGWU and
               manufacturers' associations, discussion focuses on the role of designers within manufacturing,
               conditions in the industry, the responsibility of jobbers and sub-manufacturers, and
               salary and wages. </div>

               This collection contains the first hearing of the Special Commission on June 17, 1924
               to study the situation in the Cloak and Suit Industry and be able to offer recommendations

               Investigation from March 10, 1925. There are also additional reports that were created
