            <div class="para">On April 19, 1960, the President of the U. S., acting under the authority given to
               him by the Railway Labor Act, created an Emergency Board to investigate and report
               on the dispute between the Long Island Rail Road and the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen
               Locals 517 and 1090. The members of the Board were Curtis G. Shake, Chairman, Lloyd
               H. Bailer, and Edward A. Lynch. </div>
            <div class="para"> The union's demands on the Long Island Rail Road which brought about the dispute
               were: </div>
            <div class="para"> 1. Reduction of the six-day week to five days for passenger service trainmen, without
               a reduction in pay. </div>
            <div class="para"> 2. Reduction of the work week for all men in local freight service to five days a
               week without loss of pay. The company contended that conductors and brakemen were
               required seven days a week. </div>
            <div class="para"> 3. Payment of switchtenders at the higher brakemen's rate. </div>
            <div class="para"> 4. Payment of the 95 cent daily allowance to yard trainmen not required to handle
               air hose for handling air hose. </div>
            <div class="para"> On May 18, 1960, the Emergency Board found that rates being paid to Long Island trainmen
               were higher than the standard rates on other Class I carriers. Average annual earnings
               for Long Island trainmen were $7,965 in 1959 compared with $7,263 on all other Class
               I carriers. </div>
            <div class="para"> The Railroad Trainmen then served an official notice on the Long Island Rail Road
               that they would go on strike at 12:01 A.M., Sunday, June 19. </div>
            <div class="para"> Two days before the strike was scheduled to begin, W. P. Kennedy, International President
               of the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, ordered locals 517 and 1090 to postpone the
               strike on an appeal by the National Mediation Board for a resumption of conferences
               "in the public interest." </div>
            <div class="para"> Efforts of the National Mediation Board to avert the strike collapsed one week later,
               which released the trainmen from their no strike pledge and a strike was tentatively
               set for Sunday, July 10 at 12:01 am. After authorization received from International
               President Kennedy, July 10 was confirmed as the strike date. </div>
            <div class="para"> On July 6, Governor Rockefeller took personal charge of efforts to prevent a strike
               on the Long Island Rail Road. He sent telegrams to company and union executives asking
               them to meet with George Moskowitz, Chairman of the State Mediation Board. Governor
               Rockefeller stepped in only after the union had rejected a plea by city, state and
               county officials for a two week postponement of the strike. </div>
            <div class="para"> The Governor was able to persuade the railroad to accept a five day work week, but
               only with the stipulation that the union agree to moves which would help keep the
               costs at a minimum. The union refused to accept any economy moves and the conference
               ended without success. </div>
            <div class="para"> The strike began, as scheduled, on Sunday morning, July 10. The State Public Service
               Commission immediately authorized all bus companies in Nassau and Suffolk counties
               and in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens to provide all possible transportation to the
               strike affected area. The Transport Workers Union supported the trainmen, refusing
               to work overtime and by not working on extra buses or subway trains in Queens or Long
               Island. </div>
            <div class="para"> Industrial Commissioner Martin P. Catherwood then appointed a State Board of Inquiry
               consisting of the Very Rev. Philip E. Dobson of Fordham University, Peter J. Keulemans
               of General Bronze Co., and Dean John W. McConnell of Industrial and Labor Relations
               School at Cornell University. The board was directed to study all factors necessary
               to guarantee safe and efficient commuter service "with benefit to the economy of the
               area and at prices the commuting public can afford," and to make recommendations to
               help end the strike. </div>
            <div class="para"> The Board of Inquiry proposed an arbitration plan on July 14 which called for a five
               day week with no cut in pay for the trainmen. Also included was a provision which
               would leave to final and binding arbitration the issue of how the shorter work week
               would be paid for. The union refused to accept binding arbitration. </div>
            <div class="para"> On July 20 the National Mediation Board proposed a plan whereby the BRT would agree
               to a 2 1/2 cent-an-hour wage cut to help pay for the increased cost of a five day
               week. This proposal was accepted by the union but the railroad rejected it saying
               that the increased costs would still necessitate higher fares for passengers. The
               company again suggested binding arbitration on the method of financing the shorter
               work week, but the union still refused. </div>
            <div class="para"> On August 3, 1960, Governor Rockefeller called the disputing parties together for
               a conference which lasted eleven and one-half hours before an agreement was reached.
               The three year agreement guaranteed a five day week. The cost of the shortened work
               week was set at $357,592, of which the company agreed to pay $162,041. The trainmen
               absorbed the remainder of the cost by agreeing to a 2 1/2 cent-an-hour wage cut and
               changes in work rules enabling more complete utilization of the existing work force.
               The union withdrew its demand for a five day week in freight service in return for
               a total of $53,040 in added compensation. The union won agreement to its other two
               demands. Yard service men will receive 95 cents per day for coupling air hose and
               switchtenders will receive extra pay when performing brakemen's duties.</div>  </a>
