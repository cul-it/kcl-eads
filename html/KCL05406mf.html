            <div class="para">In 1898 Congress passed the Erdman Act which provided for the mediation and arbitration
               of disputes in the railroad industry which involved the operating brotherhoods, telegraphers
               and switchmen. Within a year after its adoption the switchmen, represented by the
               Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, invoked the law, which resulted in the complete
               failure because its principles were repudiated by the leading railroad companies involved.
               </div>
            <div class="para"> The Act provided that when a controversy over rates of pay, working conditions or
               grievances arose, which could not be solved at the local level, a grand officer of
               the national organization would take the matter up with the railroads involved. If
               he failed to secure a settlement the matter was to be referred to the employees for
               a strike vote. If they voted to strike, a further effort was to be made by the national
               officer and the road to negotiate a settlement. If this failed either party could
               apply to the mediators designated in the Erdman Act for the use of their good offices
               to avert the strike. If the mediator was unable to get the parties to agree, he was
               authorized to try to get an agreement to submit the dispute to arbitration. </div>
            <div class="para"> The next attempt to use the Erdman Act's procedures did not come until 1996, but
               by the end of 1909 24 controversies had been submitted to the mediators. These were
               settled by the mediators without resort to arbitration in all but four cases. It was
               in 1906 that the railroad unions began what has been called the "concerted movement"
               as a method of handling negotiations. Under this plan the railroads in a given territory
               were served with a notice that the union desired to revise the agreements, and a committee
               of managers and a committee representing the employees met for this purpose. The firemen
               have been given credit for starting the second "concerted movement" to raise wages
               and improve working conditions in 1910, undoubtedly because 26,000 men and 110,000
               miles of railroad were involved, but the Switchmen's agreement to submit the issues
               to arbitration was signed on January 19, 1910 while that of the firemen was not signed
               until March 25, 1910. </div>
            <div class="para"> The agreement listed several issues which were to be decided by the arbitration board.
               It was also agreed that the award would be binding on both parties, the men would
               not resign, nor the employer discharge anyone for a period of three months after the
               award was made because they were not satisfied with the conditions of the award. </div>
            <div class="para"> The Board was composed of Carl R. Gray of St. Louis, Missouri, who represented the
               employers, S. E. Heberling of Moriority, New Mexico, represented the employees and
               S. S. Gregory was selected as the neutral chairman. </div>
            <div class="para"> Hearings were held in Chicago beginning on March 4, 1910. The first issue was a six
               cent raise for the switchmen. The following rates of pay were requested for all men
               on Chicago lines. </div>
            <div class="para"> Day foremen $.41 per hour </div>
            <div class="para"> Night foremen $.43 per hour </div>
            <div class="para"> Day helpers $.38 per hour </div>
            <div class="para"> Night helpers $.40 per hour </div>
            <div class="para"> In addition all the switch tenders, tower men and assistant yardmasters who were
               receiving less than this should be raised to the same scale as that of the helpers,
               anyone receiving more than this should have his rate increased accordingly. The switchmen
               based their request upon the increase in the cost of living which they estimated to
               be 50%; while the companies maintained that the cost of living was not a standard
               to be used in seating wage rates. </div>
            <div class="para"> The switchmen insisted that they were entitled to a wage increase because their efficiency
               had risen as a result of the improved equipment, such as the larger engines and modern
               cars which had been introduced. They also maintained that the heavier engines and
               improved equipment increased the risk in an occupation already very hazardous. </div>
            <div class="para"> The companies countered this by insisting the new equipment was not as hazardous,
               and accidents were not as frequent. If the switchmen's wages were raised, other employees
               would also demand increases, which the companies could not afford to pay, unless railroad
               rates were increased, which they could not do without permission. In addition, many
               roads were in the hands of receivers and wage increases would result in more receiverships.
               </div>
            <div class="para"> In its report issued on March 22, 1910 the Board discussed each of these issues and
               awarded a three cent increase, retroactive to February 10, 1910. </div>
            <div class="para"> In 1906 Switchmen's joined with the American Federation of Labor. SUNA was one of
               the first unions that started the Railway Labor Excutives' Association in 1926. They
               tried to start a merger of train movement unions in 1929 with the Brotherhood of Railroad
               Trainmen and the Order of Railway Conductors, but, were unsuccessful. In 1935 SUNA
               joined with the Canadian Labour Congress. </div>
            <div class="para"> In 1950 the government seized the railroads after a series of disputes between the
               railroads and yard employees in connection with the 40-hour week. On June 15, 1950
               the Railway labor Act Emergency Board ruled in favor of the 40-hour basic work week,
               overtime pay for hours in excess of 40, and other improvements. </div>
            <div class="para"> The Switchmen's Union of North America had 275 lodges and 12,000 members in the United
               States and Canada by 1969. That year it combined with the Brotherhood of Locomotive
               Firemen and Enginemen, Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen and Order of Railway Conductors
               and Brakemen to form the United Transportation Union.</div>  </a>
