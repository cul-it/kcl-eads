            <div class="para">The Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen [BRT] was founded in 1883 in Oneonta, N.Y. as
               a protective and insurance organization. It was established to represent members'
               interests in obtaining a satisfactory contract with management. The first Canadian
               lodge was established in Moncton, New Brunswick in 1885, and the first Ladies' Auxiliary
               was organized in Fort Gratiot, Michigan in 1889 by Sophia Granger, wife of Henry Granger,
               treasurer of St. Clair Lodge 241, with the support of the wives, sisters, and mothers
               of the St. Clair Lodge members. </div>
            <div class="para"> The purpose of the organization was to promote social interaction and mutual aid
               among the spouses of operating railroad workers in this craft. The rail service members
               of the BRT included conductors and their assistants, dining car stewards, ticket collectors,
               train baggagemen, brakemen, and train flagmen. The yard service members of the BRT
               included yardmasters, yard conductors, switchtenders, foremen, flagmen, brakemen,
               switchmen, car tenders, operators, hump riders, and car operators. </div>
            <div class="para"> In 1969, the BRT merged with three other railroad labor unions to form the United
               Transportation Union [UTU]. The Ladies' Auxiliary was granted its new charter from
               the UTU in 1970.</div>  </a>

            <div class="para"> This collection contains two bound volumes. One is the Minutes of the Iowa State
               Union Meetings of the Ladies' Auxiliary to the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen and
               its successor, the Iowa Joint Board, Ladies' Auxiliary of the United Transportation
               Union. The minutes include such information as where the meetings were held, which
               Locals were represented, the various order of business discussed at the meetings,
               and, in the minutes of the 1969 meeting, discussion about the merger of the BRT into
               the UTU. </div>
            <div class="para"> The second volume is a King James Bible, referred to in correspondence as the "Travelling
               Bible for State of Kansas, Ladies' Auxiliary to the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen."
               This book was given as an award to the Kansas Local that had admitted the greatest
               number of new members from one year's meeting to the next. The list of Locals it was
               awarded to is inscribed on the front flyleaf.</div>  </a>
