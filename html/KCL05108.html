            <div class="para">The Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America was organized in December 1914, after
               the militant New York City locals of the United Garment Workers of America had been
               denied representation at that body's October convention. Although the purposes of
               the Union were expressed by its Constitution in terms of class struggle and worker
               solidarity, ACW leaders instituted a program of union- management cooperation based
               upon the experiences of the International Ladies' Garment Workers Union with the Protocols
               of 1910-1913, and the UGW locals in New York and Chicago with the establishment of
               permanent arbitration machinery during the same period. </div>
            <div class="para"> A prototype of subsequent agreements in the men's clothing industry may be found
               in Chicago Hart, Schaffner &amp; Marx agreements of 1911-1913, since they involved the
               Union and a single manufacturer, rather than the Union and the associated manufacturers
               of a particular geographical area, as was the casein the ladies' garment industry.
               These agreements, however, differed from the majority of Amalgamated Clothing Workers'
               agreements in following theProtocol's model of grievance machinery: "Clerks" for the
               workers and the employers attempted to settle disputes on the shop level. In cases
               of disagreement, the matter went to a "Board of Trade" </div>
            <div class="para"> (Board of Grievances) composed of equal numbers of representing both sides, but with
               an impartial chairman. Supreme authority was held by a Board of Arbitration, composed
               of a representative each of the Union and the manufacturer, and a third person not
               connected with the industry chosen by the other two. </div>
            <div class="para"> So complex a system was suitable for the Chicago market, where a few large manufacturers
               dominated the production of ready-to-wear clothing, or a market in which a strong
               association of manufacturers might be established. Such an association did exist in
               Rochester, New York, a conservative city where large firms offering year round employment
               were organized into the Rochester Clothing Exchange. </div>
            <div class="para"> Amicable relations between a powerful union and a powerful association were virtually
               assured, if the Amalgamated Clothing Workers could break down the resistance of employers
               to the unionization of their workers. At the same time, the absence of intense competition
               among manufacturers, in the Rochester market limited the area of friction between
               employees and employers, and permitted a more simple arbitration system to be instituted.
               </div>
            <div class="para"> Organizing efforts were relatively unsuccessful from 1915 until the summer of 1918.
               Although a number of contracts were signed with individual firms, recognition of the
               ACW was not considered by the Clothing Exchange until a strike at the Rosenberg Brothers
               factory in July, 1918, threatened the entire market with a general work stoppage.
               Arbitration by Louis E. Kirsten and William Z. Ripley, each of whom was to serve as
               Administrator of Labor Standards for the Department of War, resulted in a partial
               concession to the Union's demands for shorter hours and higher wages. </div>
            <div class="para"> On January 23, 1919, the Exchange announced that its member firms would institute
               the forty-four hour week on the first of May. Agitation by the union for an immediate
               reduction of hours resulted in the signing of the first agreement between the Exchange
               and the Amalgamated, 13 February 1919. This agreement granted the Union the right
               to organize, although neither the closed nor the referential-union shop was to be
               instituted In addition, machinery for arbitration of grievances was established: five
               Labor Managers were to be </div>
            <div class="para"> chosen to meet with Union representatives, one each by the four largest firms in
               the Exchange, and one by the fifteen smaller firms. </div>
            <div class="para"> An agreement of August, 1920, created a Labor Adjustment Board, composed of the five
               Labor Managers representatives of the Joint Board of the ACW, and an impartial chairman.
               The Board was empowered to review discharges, to consider demands for wage </div>
            <div class="para"> increases, and to control sanitary conditions in the shops. The substance of this
               agreement have insisted on maintaining the "open" shop, virtually complete organization
               of workers in the industry, and the establishment of a Labor Exchange in 1925, has
               given the Union the same control it would exercise in a preferential union shop market.</div>  </a>
