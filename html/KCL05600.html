            <div class="para">The Northern Pacific Railroad Company [NP] was a transcontinental railroad that operated
               across the northern part of the continental United States from Minnesota to the Puget
               Sound. It was organized in 1864 with a charter by the United States Congress signed
               by President Abraham Lincoln. Construction in both Minnesota and Washington Territory
               (now Washington State) began in 1870. The lines were joined in western Montana in
               1883, where former president Ulysses S. Grant drove in the golden spike. The railroad
               was fully completed in 1888 when a tunnel under the Cascade Mountains was completed,
               replacing a series of switchbacks over Stampede Pass that had been used as a temporary
               measure to transverse the natural barrier. </div>
            <div class="para"> The NP was headquartered in St. Paul Minnesota, and its trackage and operations were
               organized into regional divisions. These regions changed over time (see Northern Pacific
               Railway Historical Association's <a target="_top" HREF="http://research.nprha.org/NP%20Division%20Maps/NP%20Division%20Evolution.pdf"> "NP Division Evolution"</a>) as the railroad expanded its operations. The Minnesota Division, later called the
               St. Paul Division, was predominantly the area stretching from the Great Lakes to the
               Minnesota - North Dakota border. The main routes were St. Paul to Staples, Minnesota;
               St. Paul to White Bear Lake; and Staples to Dilworth, Minnesota. </div>
            <div class="para"> Although this collection is from the Minnesota Division, there are reports from other
               divisions, such as Fargo, Dakota and Yellowstone, in the correspondence and claims
               files. </div>
            <div class="para"> The NP was famous for its passenger service from Chicago to Seattle on the North
               Coast Limited train. It was also a major transporter of freight across the northern
               United States. In addition to providing access to newly opened lands, the NP also
               aided in their settlement by white Europeans, opening colonization offices in Germany
               and the Scandinavian countries, where they attracted immigrants with cheap but productive
               farmland, whose goods were then transported on NP trains. These populations settled
               primarily in Minnesota and the Dakota territories. </div>
            <div class="para"> The NP also hired large numbers of Chinese laborers, mostly from the southern provinces
               around Hong Kong, though some may have been previously employed in the building of
               the Central Pacific Railroad. It is estimated by BNSF, the NP's successor railroad,
               that 15,000 of the 25,000 required laborers needed in 1882 (<a target="_top" HREF="http://www.bnsf.com/about-bnsf/our-railroad/company-history/overview/#/32"> source</a>)were Chinese immigrants. However unlike their German and Scandinavian counterparts,
               there are minimal records about these employees. </div>
            <div class="para"> In addition to its key role in the westward expansion of the United States, the NP
               was also an innovator in technology, pioneering locomotive designs such as the 4-8-4,
               called the Northern, and the 2-8-8-4, called the Yellowstone. </div>
            <div class="para"> In 1970, NP merged with the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad and the Great
               Northern Railway to form the Burlington Northern Railroad Company. In 1996, the Burlinton
               Norther merged with the Santa Fe Railway to form the Burlington Northern and Santa
               Fe Railway [BNSF], one of the largest freight railroads in the United States, and
               as of 2007 one of seven remaining North American Class I railroads.</div>  </a>

            <div class="para"> Bulk dates: 1903 - 1945 </div>
            <div class="para"> This collection consists of records from the Northern Pacific Railroad Company, Minnesota
               division. The majority of records present in the collection are concerned with employees
               and labor relations, although there are also records documenting the daily operations
               of the train yards. Of note in this regard are the Caboose Reports (1941-1945) written
               by superintendent T. M. Flynn, which document the assignment of cabooses, i.e. if
               they were in service, out of service, serviceable, or unserviceable. Also of note
               is the correspondence regarding efficiency tests and operating risks and rules by
               trainmasters and superintendents. </div>
            <div class="para"> The labor records include a letter press book (1904-1909) of certificates of examination
               for positions of conductor and locomotive engineer on the Minnesota Division of the
               Northern Pacific Railway; a letter press book (1903-1907) documenting and recording
               dismissals and resignations of Northern Pacific Railway employees at Minneapolis,
               as well as the reason why employment has been terminated; and a series of monthly
               reports from 1945 that document employees leaving the company. Also of note is a ruling
               from the United States Railroad Administration, Railway Board of Adjustment No. 1,
               regarding yard work on Sundays. </div>
            <div class="para"> The majority of the labor records consist of claims cases brought before the Train
               Service Board of Adjustment for the Western Region involving the Brotherhood of Locomotive
               Engineers [BLE] and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen [BLF&amp;E] vs.
               the Northern Pacific Railway (1929-1934) regarding seniority, runaround, wages, additional
               mileage, overtime, work schedule, reporting pay, deadhead payment, deadhead mileage,
               pay rates (local and freight), work assignments, pay for time lost, and pay for work
               performed outside of position description. Other claims cases heard by the Train Service
               Board of Adjustment for the Western Region involve the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen
               [BRT] and the Order of Railway Conductors and Brakemen [ORC] vs. the Northern Pacific
               Railroad Company (1925-1933) regarding wage rates, mileage, overtime, deadheading,
               pay for work performed outside of position description; and time claims, with attached
               letters from E.J. Hackenberg (superintendent) regarding the dispute resolutions, decisions,
               claims, and contract rules. There is a general synopsis of many of these cases, summarizing
               decision nos. 2601-4200. </div>
            <div class="para"> The correspondence folders are arranged chronologically. The case decision folders
