            <div class="para">The Kansas City Southern Railway [KCS] is a Class 1 railroad operating in the United
               States and Mexico. The KCS was founded in 1887 in Kansas City, Missouri by Arthur
               E. Stilwell. The KCS expanded their holdings in the following decade through the acquisition
               of the Arkansas Western Railway Company and the Texarkana and Fort Smith Railway Company.
               The KCS successfully linked Kansas City with the Gulf of Mexico at its terminus in
               Port Arthur, Texas, which was named after Arthur Stilwell. </div>
            <div class="para"> KCS and its employees had been operating under series of contracts between the carrier
               and the various crafts and classes that had been in effect since 1924-1925. On January
               1, 1932, both the carrier and the unions had entered, with 130 other American railroads
               and the unions, into what was called the "Chicago Agreement." The Chicago Agreement
               was a measure designed by President Roosevelt and his administration to help lift
               America out of the Great Depression in which the wage rates of employees would remain
               unchanged, but the railroads could deduct ten percent from each employee's pay check
               for a period of one year, provided the railroads did all in their power to maintain
               or even increase their number of employees. This wage reduction was part of a broader
               trend of wage reductions, in order to try and kickstart the American economy. At the
               end of this year, a wage dispute arrose between KCS and its employees. </div>
            <div class="para"> According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, "An emergency board to investigate
               the wage dispute between the Kansas City Southern Railway and its engineers, firemen,
               conductors, and trainmen, was appointed on June 12, 1933. The carrier and these employees
               were parties to the so-called "Chicago agreement" of January 31, 1932, which provided
               for a 10-percent deduction from the wages of the employees during the year beginning
               February 1, 1932. On December 31, 1932, the agreement was extended to October 31,
               1933, on most of the railroads. The Kansas City Southern Railway Co. was not a party
               to the extension agreement, but continued to make the 10 percent deduction under the
               terms of a mediation agreement entered into February 23, 1933. On April 5, 1933, the
               carrier served notice of cancelation, on May 15, 1933, of all contracts covering rates
               of pay, rules, and working conditions. On April 6, 1933, it declared its intention
               of placing in effect on May 16, 1933, new rates of pay, rules, and working conditions.
               Conferences and mediation were unsuccessful, and on June 6, 1933, the employees voted
               overwhelmingly to strike.</div>
            <div class="para"> On July 12, 1933, the emergency board reported its findings, pointing out the employees'
               belief that acceptance of the company's demands would mean 'a complete breakdown of
               the many years of efforts of organized railroad labor and would be and become an opening
               wedge toward the ultimate breakdown of these conditions upon all the other railroads
               in this country.' In deference to the wish of President [Roosevelt] 'for peace between
               labor and employer while the country is trying to regain prosperity,' expressed in
               a letter to [the KCS] president, the carrier postponed putting into effect the proposed
               new schedule until early in 1934, continuing in the meantime under the existing rates
               of pay, rules, and working conditions" (Handbook of Labor Statistics, 1936 Edition,
               Issue 616, pp. 22-23). </div>
            <div class="para"> In 1934, the same issues arose between KCS and their employees. President Roosevelt
               dispatch Joseph B. Eastman, Federal Coordinator of Transportation, to mediate between
               the parties. The strike was once again postponed while the parties submitted themselves
               to mediation.</div>  </a>

            <div class="para"> This collection contains documentation of a wage dispute between the Kansas City
               Southern Railways [KCS] and their employees represented by the "Big Four" railroad
               brotherhoods: the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers [BLE]; the Brotherhood of Locomotive
               Firemen and Enginemen [BLF&amp;E]; the Order of Railway Conductors [ORC]; and the Brotherhood
               of Railroad Trainmen [BRT]. </div>
            <div class="para"> The records in this collection document the wages of employees who were members of
               one of the Big Four as well as how those wages would be affected by a proposed change
               to wage schedules by KCS management. Reactions to these changes from the union representatives,
               employees, and various managers are found in both correspondence and in pamphlets
               printed by both sides of the dispute to try to influence public opinion. The wage
               schedules are heavily annotated to show how the wages for the employees would fall
               should the KCS plan be put in place. Newspaper clippings documenting the negotiations
               are found in this collection. Of interest are the minutes of the meetings of the unions
               where the vast majority of the employees voted in favor of a strike and the correspondence
               between the grand chairmen of the Big Four, wherein they establish a series of code
               words to be used to verify the authenticity of any correspondence regarding a strike.
               Telegrams calling off the strike because of the intervention of the federal government
               are also found in the collection.</div>  </a>
