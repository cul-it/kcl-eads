            <div class="para">Founded in 1900 by local union delegates representing about 2,000 members in cities
               in the northeastern United States, the ILGWU grew in geographical scope, membership
               size, political influence to become one of the most powerful forces in American organized
               labor by mid-century. Representing workers in the women's garment industry, the ILGWU
               worked to improve working and living conditions of its members through collective
               bargaining agreements, training programs, health care facilities, cooperative housing,
               educational opportunities, and other efforts. In 1995, the ILGWU merged with the Amalgamated
               Clothing and Textile Workers Union (ACTWU) to form the Union of Needletrades, Industrial
               and Textile Employees (UNITE).</div>  </a>

            <div class="para">Elias Lieberman had a long history and career with the ILGWU. Born on November 10,
               1888, he came from Russia in 1909. He was the deputy clerk of Local 25 from 1913-1916
               and the chief clerk from 1916-1917. Lieberman was the chairman of the union's Educational
               Committee in 1917, and from 1918-1920, he was with the publication department of the
               International. Afterwards, he became an attorney and counsel for the ILGWU until the
               1960s. Lieberman was a member of the New York and Federal Bar, was counsel for not
               only the ILGWU, but also the United Hatters, Cap and Millinery Workers' International
               Union, the International Jewelry Workers' Union, Local 1, the United Furniture Workers
               of America, the International Ladies Handbag, Pocketbook and Novelty Workers' Union
               and other labor organizations. In addition, Lieberman wrote on many aspects of the
               law and labor including "The Collective Labor Agreement: How to Negotiate and Draft
               the Contract" (1939) and "Unions Befor the Bar: Historic Trials Showing the Evolution
               of Labor Rights in the United States" (1950). Lieberman died in October 1969.</div>  </a>

            <div class="para">The collection contains the unpublished manuscripts of Elias Lieberman. As a lawyer,
               Lieberman's manuscripts often involve legal matters, including trials, testimonies
               and transcripts. But with Lieberman's lengthy involvement with the ILGWU, the historical
               accounts are not merely reports of proceedings, but personal eye witness narratives
               that provide additional insight into the union and garment industry. </div>
            <div class="para"> "The Changing Images of American Trade Unionism: A Threat to Labor and a Challenge
               to the Statesmen of Labor," at twenty seven typed pages, discusses the varying view
               of organized labor and labor leaders with sections entitled "The Image of the Helpless
               Worker," "The Image of the Union as the Underdog," "The Image of the Rightless," "The
               Image of Idealism," "The Image of Protection," "The Threat to Labor," "The Challenge,"
               "Guilt by Classification," "A Moral Force of Labor," and "Will the Challenge be Met."
               </div>
            <div class="para"> "A Portrait of Seventh Avenue: Events and Human-Interest Stories of, by, and about
               the Garment Center in New York City" is comprised of stories about the people and
               historic events of 7th Avenue, focusing on human interest accounts about the manufacturers,
               contractors and workers. Also included is information on the garment industry and
               its progress in labor- management relations, including the establishment of industry
               "courts" to settle disputes between unions and employers. The manuscript focuses on
               those "courts" and the stories that arose from firsthand knowledge and personal interviews,
               and while based on fact, the author took the liberty to polish facts and change names.
               The short stories often center around a particular individual or event, sometimes
               recounted through a crime, arbitration or court trial. Lieberman presents pressers,
               contractors, shop owners, machine operators, all having personal stories that paint
               a broad picture of the garment industry. </div>
            <div class="para"> "The Mysterious Disappearance of Juliet or A Lady Communist Vanishes (A True Story),"
               focuses on the disappearance of Mrs. Julia S. Glaser, also known as Miss Juliet Stuart
               Poyntz. Lieberman had been representing Poyntz in Surrogate's Court in connection
               with her late husband's estate. Poyntz first became involved with the garment industry
               and the union when she was hired as the first educational director of the Dressmakers'
               Union (at the behest of Morris Hillquit), in which she developed a program for adult
               labor education, set up lecture series by professors, and organized dancing and recreation
               classes. She also launched some of the early cooperative housing initiatives for the
               young and unmarried immigrant girls of the union, and the concept of "unity houses"
               soon expanded into vacation retreats, whose popularity led to the union's purchase
               of the Unity House summer resort in the Poconos. After much success instituting programs,
               Poyntz was offered the position of Education Director of the ILGWU. Lieberman's history
               with Poyntz dates back to her time with the ILGWU as he headed the union's Committee
               on Education which provided the approval for her educational plans and programs. She
               was last seen on June 5, 1937 and missing for four months before a friend of Poyntz
               informed Lieberman that the American Woman's Club, where she had been staying, contacted
               her to inquire about the unpaid rent. Lieberman initially performed a private investigation
               before contacting police. Poyntz was active in the Communist Party and became the
               head of the Women's Department of the CPUSA. She also worked for the Soviet Secret
               Police. From his personal knowledge of Poyntz and involvement in the case, Lieberman
               discusses Poyntz's history, the circumstances surrounding her disappearance, and the
               many theories that circulated regarding her vanishing. </div>
            <div class="para"> The unbound manuscript pages for "A Portrait of a Leader: A True Labor Story of a
               Man and an Era" tells the story of Morris Sigman, president of the ILGWU from 1923-1928.
               The account begins with the death of Herman Liebowitz in July 1910. Liebowitz, a strikebreaker
               during the Great Revolt of 1910, was found beaten to death on a New York sidewalk.
               Four years later, Morris Sigman, Morris Stupnicker, and Solomon Metz were arrested
               for his murder. After being released on bail, the case was continually adjourned month
               after month until on May 11, 1915, Sigman, Stupnicker, and Metz were rearrested along
               with Julius Woolf, Abraham Weidiger, Max D. Singer, Isidore Asphitz and Louis Holzer,
               and charged with the murder of Liebowitz. In September, the charges against Holzer
               were dismissed, and the "Trial of the Seven Cloakmakers" began September 23, 1915
               in New York Supreme Court with Assistant ADA Lucien S. Breckinridge and DA Charles
               A. Perkins, and Morris Hillquit who served as the defense attorney. The trial ended
               in a not guilty verdict and the manuscript provides an eyewitness account of the events,
               even providing word for word accounts of the court room, including opening statements,
               witness questioning and testimony, and closing arguments. </div>
            <div class="para"> The manuscript also offers a complete account on the history of the ILGWU, including
               such events as the Uprising of 20,000 (1909), the Great Revolt (1910) and the internal
               struggle within the union and with Dr. Hourwich. But mainly the pages focus on the
               life of Sigman and his tenure with the union. Detailed is Sigman's early history,
               including coming to New York and finding work as a presser, his early involvement
               with the Socialist Labor Party and the IWW, his work to form an independent union
               of cloak pressers, and his eventual involvement with the ILGWU. Sigman quickly moved
               up the ranks of the ILGWU holding various positions until his election in 1914 as
               general secretary-treasurer. Also interspersed is background information on Benjamin
               Schlesinger, David Dubinsky, and Charles Zimmerman. Particular attention is paid to
               the tempestuous nature of Sigman's presidency, the behind the scenes internal struggle
               among the Communists and the union, as well as the internal struggle that ultimately
               unseated Sigman. During his time as president, an opposition faction existed within
               the union that sought to change the election of officers to a memorandum vote of the
               membership after the convention instead of the current practice of election through
               the majority of present delegates at the convention. Such a change would require a
               change in the union's constitution. The referendum was rejected and Sigman re-elected
               president in 1925 while Schlesinger (who was the opposition's choice for the presidency)
               became a new vice president. As internal tensions continued, Sigman resigned due to
               differences in principle for the welfare of the union at the general executive board
               meeting in October 1928. Upon his resignation, Schlesinger became the president of
               the union for the third time. </div>
            <div class="para"> The manuscript continues with Sigman's retirement and home life with his wife at
               their amusement park in Iowa, his health and illnesses, his return to New York to
               find employment as a presser, and his sudden death on July 19, 1931 from a heart attack.
               Lieberman intimately documents the life and legacy of Morris Sigman.</div>  </a>
