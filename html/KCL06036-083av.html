            <div class="para">Founded in 1900 by local union delegates representing about 2,000 members in cities
               in the northeastern United States, the ILGWU grew in geographical scope, membership
               size, political influence to become one of the most powerful forces in American organized
               labor by mid-century. Representing workers in the women's garment industry, the ILGWU
               worked to improve working and living conditions of its members through collective
               bargaining agreements, training programs, health care facilities, cooperative housing,
               educational opportunities, and other efforts. In 1995, the ILGWU merged with the Amalgamated
               Clothing and Textile Workers Union (ACTWU) to form the Union of Needletrades, Industrial
               and Textile Employees (UNITE).</div>  </a>

            <div class="para">Gerald Hirschfeld was the director of photography for the film "With These Hands."
               Hirschfeld was born on April 25, 1921 and became interested in photography at an early
               age. He began to work in films in the late 1940s as a cinematographer but soon moved
               to commercials. Hirschfeld returned to movies when he was hired by Sidney Lumet for
               the 1964 movie "Fail-Safe." He would continue to work as a director of photography
               on such films as "Diary of a Mad Housewife," "Young Frankenstein," and "My Favorite
               Year," as well as television movies.</div>  </a>

            <div class="para"> The headlines and reviews enthusiastically lauded the International Ladies' Garment
               Workers' Union (ILGWU) 1950 film "With These Hand" with praises not normally associated
               with a motion picture produced by a labor union. Through its history, the ILGWU knew
               the importance and benefits of utilizing entertainment and media to spread their message.
               The union owned FM radio stations, produced radio programs, sponsored paid television
               broadcasts, and ran advertisements in newspapers. Surprisingly, the union even had
               success in the field of Broadway with the popular 1937 show "Pins &amp;amp; Needles,"
               which featured a cast of garment workers and became a hit with critics and audiences.
               Hollywood and a foray into motion pictures soon beckoned the union. Previous attempts
               by other labor unions to create institutional films tended to be amateurish and propaganda
               that would not draw large crowds outside the intended audience of union members. The
               ILGWU and President David Dubinsky wanted to change the perception of labor films
               and try the impossibleto create a movie that celebrated the first fifty years of the
               union while providing genuine entertainment and appealing to the general public. To
               ensure a professional production, the union secured veterans in the entertainment
               industry, and Jack Arnold and Lee Goodman were hired to direct and produce a story
               written by Morton Wishengrad. Arnold would later go on to become a famous science
               fiction director of such movies as "It Came from Outer Space" and "Creature From the
               Black Lagoon," as well as television episodes of "Gilligan's Island," "The Brady Bunch,"
               and "The Love Boat." Well known stage and Broadway actors were also hired to perform
               the lead roles in the film. Sam Levene plays the main character Alexander Brody. Levene
               started in Hollywood in the 1930s, starring alongside William Powell and Myrna Loy
               in the "Thin Man" movies, and he had a successful career on Broadway as well, originating
               the role of Nathan Detroit in "Guys and Dolls." Other members of the cast include
               stage and screen actress Arlene Francis who may be best remembered as a panelist on
               the long running television game show "What's My Line," and Joseph Wiseman, who found
               fame as James Bond's first villain, the iconic Dr. No. The pedigree of the individuals
               associated with the movie helped to establish "With These Hands" as anything but a
               traditional labor film. </div>
            <div class="para"> "With These Hands" premiered on June 15, 1950 at the Gotham Theatre in New York City
               and played for a full month. The film performed even better outside of New York where
               attendance had only been average. The Education Department of the ILGWU maintained
               prints that were rented out, and locals, departments, and other unions and organizations
               purchased copies for viewing. It continued to draw audiences across the country and
               was very much in demand playing for union members in local theaters and for students
               at colleges and universities. At a one hour running time, the ILGWU particularly promoted
               the film to educators and history teachers, as well as trade union members at meetings
               and conventions. Following the film, discussions often arose around such topics as
               industrial relations, economics, history, and labor issues. By 1951, the movie was
               playing internationally in the Netherlands, Italy, Belgium, Sweden, Denmark, Norway,
               Austria, Germany, England, France, Greece, and Canada, through cooperation with the
               U.S. State Department and Embassies and the United States Information Service and
               Economic Cooperation Administration. It was well received and supported by trade unions
               in the other countries. The movie later found an additional audience when it was shown
               on local television affiliates across the country. "With These Hands" received the
               ultimate compliment from the entertainment industry with a nomination in 1951 for
               an Academy Award for Best Documentary (Feature), though it lost to "The Titan: Story
               of Michelangelo." Despite its popularity, "With These Hands" did receive some criticism.
               There were complaints regarding the depiction of Jews in the film, mainly the portrayal
               of the bosses in the factories even though the workers were also Jewish. The majority
               of the requests for censorship originated internationally in the foreign markets and
               the main objections were the references to Communism in the film. "With These Hands"
               was banned in India after being shown for five years to much popularity, Yugoslavia
               refused to show the movie, and there were mixed reviews from both the Communists and
               anti-Communists in Italy. Ultimately, the film was well received from many different
               and diverse communities. </div>
            <div class="para">  "With These Hands" opens with the main character, Alexander Brody, turning 65 and
               applying for retirement benefits under the Union Pension Fund. Brody begins to reflect
               on his life in the garment industry and union, taking the audience back to 1910 when
               he was a cloak operator in a small sweatshop and joining the ILGWU. The early days
               of the garment industry are visually documented by the crowded tenements, the horrible
               working conditions of 14 hour days in the cramped sweatshops, and the employees toiling
               under abusive bosses without any job security. Brody questions the policies in the
               shop when his boss unjustly fines another worker and he is quickly dismissed from
               his job, packing up his sewing machine and leaving the factory. He attends meetings
               of the ILGWU and participates in the Cloakmaker's Strike of 1910. The general strike
               began on July 7, 1910 and workers stopped, left their jobs and began filling the streets.
               At its height, some 40,000 men and 10,000 women were involved to protest the low wages,
               long hours, and late nights and weekends sewing bundles at home. To help finance the
               strike, the film shows the union members and their families giving up jewelry, watches
               and valuables, as well as the hard times the unemployed workers like Brody experienced
               on the picket lines and the sacrifices their families made at home. After 58 days
               on strike, the union won recognition and Brody and his fellow garment workers were
               back in the shops under better working conditions. "With These Hands" continues to
               illustrate historical events, providing a dramatization of the March 25, 1911 Triangle
               Factory Fire tragedy in which the women workers found themselves locked in the shop
               when a fire broke out resulting in the deaths of 146 young girls. The fire prompted
               new safety laws and legislation. The film continues to take the viewer through the
               first fifty years of the union and the changes in the industry visually illustrating
               the strike of 1926, the rise of Communism within the ranks and the union's reaction,
               the effect of the Great Depression and the emergence of the Blue Eagle label of the
               National Recovery Administration (NRA) codes. As the events unfold, Brody works his
               way through the ranks of the union. Organizing efforts spread to small towns across
               the country and the membership increases. As the union continues to thrive and flourish,
               Brody's working and living conditions also continue to improve as well, as he moves
               from a tiny tenement in the beginning of the movie to a well-appointed apartment in
               the end. The film details the gains made by the union through contract negotiations
               showing how piece rates are settled and disputes resolved through arbitration under
               the collective bargaining agreement. Brody's involvement in various union activities
               illustrates the wide range of benefits that the union offered; the Education Department's
               art and music classes and the ILGWU Officer Qualification courses, vacations with
               pay and the union's summer resort Unity House, and medical care provided at the Union
               Health Center. Throughout the film, Brody marvels at the journey of the ILGWU and
               its members and how far his hands have taken him since he started in 1910.</div>  </a>
