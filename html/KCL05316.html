            <div class="para">The Western Union Telegraph Company was one of the forerunners in company unions.
               In 1918 or so, the company started the Association of Western Union Employees. In
               1938, the American Communications Association ClO, who were trying to organize the
               Western Union employees, challenged the Company Union. The ACA (American Communications
               Association) filed charges with the National Labor Relations Board, September 1938,
               seeking the dis-establishment of the company union. The NLRB investigated the matter
               and on November 1, 1939, declared the Association of Western Union Employees was a
               company union and ordered the company to cease and desist its unfair labor practices.
               Western Union Telegraph Company did not disband the Association of Western Union Employees
               until after it received the Circuit Court of Appeals decision August 9, 1940 upholding
               the order of the NLRB. </div>
            <div class="para">  
               The American Communications Association in May 1941 petitioned the NLRB for a representation
               election for that portion of Western Union employees involved in this case (New York
               Metropolitan Division which employed approximately 5,500 persons.) On April l6, 1942,
               ACA, Local 40, CIO was certified by the NLRB as the exclusive collective bargaining
               agency and they commenced negotiations with the Company on May 15. Unable to reach
               agreement, they called in the Conciliation Service of the United States Department
               of Labor. The parties with the assistance of the conciliator were still unable to
               solve their important differences and the controversy was certified to the National
               War Labor Board on August 20, 1942. </div>
            <div class="para">  
               A Mediation Panel, consisting of Mr. Arthur S. Meyer representing the public, Mr.
               W. Lipscomb Davis representing industry, and Mr. John Brophy representing labor, was
               designated by the Board to hear the case. Hearings were conducted in Washington, D.C.
               on September 9, 10, and 11, and in New York City on September 15 16 and 17. </div>
            <div class="para">
               The main issue was wages. The union was desirous of changing the wage structure so
               that there would not be striking wage inequalities among workers in the same classification
               with the same work experience.
               The Union also was of the viewpoint that if wages were not increased, the rising trend
               of turnover would skyrocket. The turnover rate in this critical war industry was very
               important because the men were highly skilled and it took a number of years on the
               job to become proficient at the work. The Union's solution to these problems were
               presented in a three prong wage demand. First, the adoption by the Company of a stated
               hiring ratio for each job classification. Second, introduction of an automatic wage
               progression schedule based on class A work seniority. Third, cost of living wage adjust
               ment in line with the Little Steel Formula. </div>
            <div class="para">
               The Company argued against wage increases on the basis that it was a public utility
               whose prices were regulated and that it could not raise its prices to absorb wage
               increases. The Company protested that if it gave these wage increases it would be
               forced by its other employees to give them the same wage increases on a system-wide
               basis which the company deemed a financial impossibility. The company also maintained
               that it was improper for the Union to compare its wages with other industries and
               that the only legitimate comparison was with Postal Telegraph Company (deep in debt
               and on the verge of bankruptcy for a number of years) whose rates of pay were substantially
               lower than Western Union's. Furthermore, Western Union was soon to merge with the
               Postal Telegraph Company and it was going to financially strap the Company to bring
               Postal Telegraph Company employees up to present level of wages enjoyed by Western
               Union employees let alone the proposed increased wages. </div>

               and benefit plan, promotions, mechanization, continuance of existing rights and privileges,
               effect of authorized absences on an employee's company service record, and Commercial
