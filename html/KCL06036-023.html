            <div class="para">Founded in 1900 by local union delegates representing about 2,000 members in cities
               in the northeastern United States, the ILGWU grew in geographical scope, membership
               size, political influence to become one of the most powerful forces in American organized
               labor by mid-century. Representing workers in the women's garment industry, the ILGWU
               worked to improve working and living conditions of its members through collective
               bargaining agreements, training programs, health care facilities, cooperative housing,
               educational opportunities, and other efforts. In 1995, the ILGWU merged with the Amalgamated
               Clothing and Textile Workers Union (ACTWU) to form the Union of Needletrades, Industrial
               and Textile Employees (UNITE).</div>  </a>

            <div class="para">Jay Lovestone was born on December 24, 1898 in Lithuania, which was then a part of
               Russia. His father obtained a job in a New York synagogue and Lovestone came with
               his family to the U.S. at the age of 9. He graduated from City College in 1918 and
               soon found himself involved in the Socialist and Communist movements. Lovestone became
               a founding member of the American Communist Party in 1919, and became editor of the
               Communist Party publication "The Communist" in 1921. Lovestone led the party from
               1927 until his expulsion in 1929. Lovestone and his followers formed the Communist
               Party of the United States, later the Independent Labor League of America, but more
               commonly known as the "Lovestonites," which disbanded in 1940. In 1943, Lovestone
               was appointed the founding director of the International Ladies' Garment Workers'
               (ILGWU) International Affairs Department. He went on to serve as Secretary of the
               Free Trade Union Committee, director of the International Confederation of Free Trade
               Unions, and director of the AFL-CIO's Department of International Affairs, serving
               from 1963 until his retirement in 1974. Lovestone died on March 7, 1990 at the age
               of 91.</div>  </a>
