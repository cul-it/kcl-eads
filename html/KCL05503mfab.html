            <div class="para">Terence Vincent Powderly was born in Carbondale, Penn. In 1849. A machinist by trade,
               Powderly became active in union organizing, eventually becoming the chief executive
               officer of the Order of the Knights of Labor, a post he held from 1879 to 1893. He
               was also active in politics and served three terms as mayor of Scranton, Penn. (1878-1884).
               After resigning as General Master Workman of the Knights, Powderly was admitted to
               the Pennsylvania bar in 1894 and re-entered political life </div>
            <div class="para">  while practicing law. He served in several important posts in the Bureau of Immigration
               (1898-1921) as well as as commissioner of conciliation with the Department of Labor,
               a post he held from 1921 until his death in 1924. </div>
            <div class="para"> Terence Vincent Powderly, the son of Terence and Madge Walsh Powderly, both Irish
               immigrants, was born on January 23, 1849, in Carbondale, Pennsylvania. Life among
               sven brothers and four sisters was spartan, and young Powderly had little opportunity
               to obtain much more than a rudimentary education. At age thirteen, Powderly took his
               first job as switchman for the Delaware and Hudson Railroad. He had decided on a career
               as a machinist, and in August, 1866, he was apprenticed for three years to master
               machinist, James Dickson. At the end of his apprenticeship in August, 1869, Powderly
               found employment in the machine shops of the Pennsylvania Coal Company. He was later
               employed in the machine shops of the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad Company
               in Scranton, Pennsylvania. </div>
            <div class="para"> At the time Powderly joined the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad the Long
               Strike was in progress among the anthracite coal miners in Pennsylvania. Powderly's
               experiences during the Long Strike and the mine explosions at Avondale, Pennsylvania,
               in September, 1869, proved to be important influences in his life. Determined to do
               what he could to relieve the plight of his fellow workers, he joined the International
               Union of Machinists and Blacksmiths in 1971. He later became president of his local
               chapter. </div>
            <div class="para"> In 1873, the United States experienced a severe economic depression. This depression,
               coupled with Powderly's union activities, led to his dismissal. During the winter
               of 1873-1874, Powderly traveled through several Midwestern states and Canada in search
               of work. He finally found a job in Galion, Ohio, only to be fired because his name
               appeared on a blacklist of union agitators. Powderly frequently experienced blacklisting
               during the 1870s. </div>
            <div class="para"> In 1876, while working in Scranton, Pennsylvania, Powderly was admitted to Scranton
               Local Assembly No. 88 of the Order of the Knights of Labor. Soon he had organized
               an assembly of the machinists and became its Master Workman. Powderly advanced rapidly
               in power and influence in the Knights of Labor. In 1877, he was elected corresponding
               secretary of District Assembly No. 5. He was elected Grand Worthy Foreman in January,
               1879, and in September was elected to the top post of Grand (later General) Master
               Workman, a post to which he was re-elected annually until he resigned in 1893. </div>
            <div class="para"> While steadily rising in the ranks of the Knights of Labor, Powderly became involved
               in Scranton politics. In 1876, he became president of the Greenback-Labor Club. From
               1878-1884, he served three terms as Scranton's mayor. During his incumbency as mayor
               Powderly worked to make Scranton a progressive city. He established a board of health
               for the city and worked for legislation against adulterated foods, to obtain a meat
               inspector, and for funds to construct a municipal sewage system. In 1880, he signed
               into law a bill which made Scranton's tax structure more equitable. Powderly's three
               terms as mayor also saw improvement in such areas as municipal improvements and an
               open city administration. </div>
            <div class="para"> When Powderly left the mayor's official in 1884, he was able, for the first time,
               to devote all his energies to the administration of the Knights of Labor. He realized
               that the Order was in the midst of a divisive internal struggle. The trade unionist
               faction within the Order believed that higher wages and better working conditions
               could best be achieved by the strike and boycott. Powderly and his supporters believed
               that the strike should be used as a last resort, only after the Order had tried to
               educate and convince management to accept its position. The abortive Southwest Strike
               of 1886 caused greater division within the union and resentment against Powderly,
               who had called off the strike. The rival American Federation of Labor, under Samuel
               Gompers, took advantage of the Knights' internal disorders and successfully interested
               dissatisfied Knights to join. </div>
            <div class="para"> The discontent within the Order continued to grow. A group of Order leaders, including
               General Secretary-Treasurer John William Hayes, formed the so-called Home Club, which
               worked for Powderly's removal from office. In 1893, Hayes and others charged Powderly
               with misuse of the Order's funds. During the November General Assembly meeting Powderly
               was exonerated and subsequently re-elected General Master Workman. Facing a hostile
               executive board, however, Powderly resigned in 1893. </div>
            <div class="para"> As General Master Workman, Powderly's policies were based on the preservation of
               the American worker's control of his job situation. He believed in the integration
               of blacks into the social and economic life of the nation, as well as the Order. He
               felt such participation would be in th ewhite laboring man's best interest. He also
               felt that women should be paid the same as men for the same work and should have equal
               opportunity for employment advancement. He fought for the eight-hour workday and the
               abolition of the wage system. He supported Chinese exclusion and protective tariff
               legislation. </div>
            <div class="para"> After resigning as General Master Workman in 1893, Powderly studied law. He was admitted
               to the Pennsylvania bar in 1894 and later admitted to practice before the Supreme
               Courts of Pennsylvania and the United States. While practicing law, Powderly re-entered
               political life. In 1894 he became a member of the Central Republican Club of Scranton.
               During the presidential campaign of 1896, Powderly was asked to campaign for William
               McKinley. After McKinley's inauguration in 1897, Powderly applied for appointment
               as Commissioner-General of Immigration. Soon after his appointment to this post in
               March, 1898, Powderly established a commission to investigate conditions at Ellis
               Island. As a result of this investigation, eleven employees were dismissed. When Theodore
               Roosevelt became president, Powderly's rivals attacked him and finally succeeded in
               obtaining his removal from office. After an investigation he was reinstated by President
               Roosevelt in 1906 as Special Immigration Inspector. Roosevelt sent him to Europe to
               study the causes of European immigration to the United States. As a result of this
               trip Powderly prepared a report in which he advocated that the Immigration Service,
               through its agents in Europe, should select prospective immigrants while they still
               resided in their home country; that agents of the serviced should be on ships carrying
               immigrants; and that once here, immigrants should be more evenly distributed throughout
               the nation. </div>
            <div class="para"> In 1907, Powderly was appointed chief of the Division of Information of the Bureau
               of Immigration, a post he held until 1921 when he was appointed a member of the bureau's
               Board of Review. From 1921 until his death on June 24, 1924, Powderly also served
               as a Commissioner of Conciliation with the Department of Labor. </div>
            <div class="para"> John William Hayes was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on December 26, 1854.
               Hayes remained in Philadelphia until about the age of seventeen. In 1871 he moved
               west to Illinois where he worked as a farm hand. Not long after he moved to Ohio where
               he was employed as a brakeman for the Dayton and Michigan Railroad. When the financial
               panic of 1871 struck, Hayes lost his job and returned to his family in New Brunswick,
               New Jersey. Hayes secured employments in 1872 as a brakeman with the Pennsylvania
               Railroad at Trenton, New Jersey, and later at Philadelphia. On May 28, 1878, he was
               involved in a serious railroad accident and lost his right arm. His next position
               was with the American Union Telegraph Company, where he remained until 1883. He was
               fired because of his involvement in union activities. </div>
            <div class="para"> In August, 1874, while employed by the Pennsylvania Railroad, Hayes was initiated
               into District Assembly 49 of the Knights of Labor. Soon after joining the Order, Uriah
               S. Stephens gave Hayes an organizer's commission. In 1884, the General Assembly elected
               Hayes a member of the General Executive Board, and in 1886, he was elected secretary
               of the board. In November, 1888, the General Assembly elected Hayes General Secretary-Treasurer
               of the Knights of Labor. </div>
            <div class="para"> Hayes's labor philosophy amplified the Knights' motto that perfect government was
               that "in which an injury to one is the concern of all." Only by implementing this
               principle could the disinherited laboring masses be free. As with Powderly, Hayes
               considered strikes as ineffective. He supported the principles of cooperation and
               education. </div>
            <div class="para"> The General Assembly elected Hayes General Master Workman of the Knights of Labor
               in 1902. While undertaking these duties, Hayes was involved in other activities. He
               was manager of the Atlantic Gas Construction Company in Philadelphia and had invented
               a coal gasification device. After the First World War, Hayes urged labor organizations
               to abjure any connections they might have with the "Red Menace." Hayes also had interests
               in stocks and lands. He was president of the North Chesapeake Beach Land and Improvement
               Company until his death in 1942.</div>  </a>

            <div class="para">The Knights of Labor constituted the most powerful force in American labor in the
               nineteenth century. It was the first national labor organization to recruit extensively
               and as a matter of policy both women and blacks, to organize throughout the country,
               and to attempt to unify industrial and agrarian workers. Between 1869 and 1896 the
               Order spanned the United States with fifteen thousand Local Assemblies.</div>  </a>

            <div class="para">The Powderly papers are composed of correspondence, financial records, diaries, printed
               matter, legal files, photographs, and scrapbooks relating primarily to Terence Powderly's
               work with the Knights of Labor. Other papers concern his work as commissioner-general
               of immigration, the Black Diamond Anthracite Coal Company, and personal and family
               matters. </div>
            <div class="para"> The bulk of the materials on the Knights of Labor (Series A) consists of correspondence
               (1864-1924), both incoming and outgoing. The most valuable portion of this correspondence
               covers the period during which Powderly served as General Master Workman (1879-1893).
               The letters reflect the growth of the Order and its position on such issues as education,
               the eight-hour workday, the use of the strike, trade unionism and blacklisting. The
               difficulties and power struggles which disrupted the Order are also evidenced. Also
               included in this series are constitutions of Local and District Assemblies as well
               as the General Assembly (1878-1890); business records consisting of two volumes of
               minutes of Local Assembly 222 of Scranton, Penn. (1876-1880) and expense accounts
               of Powderly as General Master Workman (1888-1892); proceedings, including seven proceedings
               for Local Assemblies (1883-1890), ninety-one proceedings for District Assemblies (1877-1890)
               and twenty proceedings for State Assemblies (1885-1894), as well as an incomplete
               set of proceedings for the General Assembly (1878-1902); and printed matter, consisting
               of the JOURNAL OF UNITED LABOR, vol.1 - vol.4 no.1 (1880-1883), ritual books, clippings
               scrapbooks, notes for speeches and writings, and printed leaflets, brochures, and
               form letters issued by the Knights (1886-1895). </div>
            <div class="para"> Series B (Immigration) contains Powderly's correspondence (1883-1930) in his capacity
               as commissioner-general of immigration, as chief of the Information Division of the
               Bureau of Immigration, and as commissioner of conciliation for the Department of Labor.
               Filed with the correspondence is Powderly's 1906 report on emigration to the United
               States, the result of an investigation ordered by President Theodore Roosevelt. Also
               included in this series are miscellaneous and legal files dealing with the deportation
               of immigrants as contract laborers; warrants for deportation; court cases relating
               to the Alien Contract Law; Memoranda, statistics and reports of the Immigration Bureau;
               reports on Chinese and Japanese immigration; and a transcript of the Luigi Graziano
               Case (1900) dealing with corruption in the Bureau of Immigration. Pamphlets on immigration
               (1883-1903) include reports of the commissioner-general. </div>
            <div class="para"> Series C contains correspondence, reports and circulars relating to the Black Diamond
               Anthracite Coal Company of Schuylkill County, Penn. Powderly served as president of
               the company from its founding in 1902 until 1905, when he resigned, suspecting a swindle.
               </div>
            <div class="para"> Personal papers (Series D) include correspondence (1896-1937) between Powderly and
               his friends and family, as well as with organizations to which he belonged. Powderly's
               1896 campaign activities on behalf of William McKinley are documented here. Also included
               are diaries (1869-1890), including some materials on Mother Jones, poems and speeches.
               </div>
            <div class="para"> Printed matter (Series E) (1882-1898) consists of pamphlets containing Powderly's
               speeches and reports on Local and District Assemblies; Miscellaneous files (Series
               F) (1886-1937) include correspondence, clippings, reports, interviews and speeches,
