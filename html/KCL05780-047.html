            <div class="para">The International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union was once one of the largest labor
               unions in the United States founded in 1900 by local union delegates representing
               about 2,000 members in cities in the northeastern United States. It was one of the
               first U.S. Unions to have a membership consisting of mostly females, and it played
               a key role in the labor history of the 1920s and 1930s. The union is generally referred
               to as the "ILGWU" or the "ILG". The ILGWU grew in geographical scope, membership size,
               and political influence to become one of the most powerful forces in American organized
               labor by mid-century. Representing workers in the women's garment industry, the ILGWU
               worked to improve working and living conditions of its members through collective
               bargaining agreements, training programs, health care facilities, cooperative housing,
               educational opportunities, and other efforts. The ILGWU merged with the Amalgamated
               Clothing and Textile Workers Union in 1995 to form the Union of Needle trades, Industrial
               and Textile Employees (UNITE). UNITE merged with the Hotel Employees and Restaurant
               Employees Union (HERE) in 2004 to create a new union known as UNITE HERE. The two
               unions that formed UNITE in 1995 represented only 250,000 workers between them, down
               from the ILGWU's peak membership of 450,000 in 1969.</div>  </a>

            <div class="para">Beginning in 1900, manufacturers of shirtwaists branched out and began to create dresses.
               Local 25 Ladies' Waist Makers' Union was chartered in 1905 after the reorganization
               of unsuccessful locals. By 1908, there were over 600 waist and dress shops in New
               York employing over 30,000 workers. Long hours of 56 hour weeks, overtime, low pay,
               and rampant sub-contracting led to agitation among the poorly treated women workers.
               Smaller strikes throughout 1909 over the intolerable conditions paved the way for
               a meeting at Cooper Union on November 22. Thousands filled the hall when 23 year old
               Clara Lemlich, a striker on a picket line, rose to spoke and called for a general
               strike. The "Uprising of Twenty Thousand" involved waist makers from New York, Brooklyn,
               and Brownsville. Amidst hunger, cold, imprisonment, and unscrupulous bosses, the women
               on the picket lines continued their fight, the strike lasting fourteen weeks until
               February 15, 1910. While not a complete success, the strike did result in individual
               contracts, higher wages, and a large increase in union membership. As the industry
               expanded over the years, so did the union, becoming Local 25 Waist and Dress Makers'
               Union, which would soon become the biggest local in the union. In the beginning of
               1913, another strike involved 30,000 workers and resulted in a collective agreement.
               Workers left their shops again in February 1916 ending with a revised Protocol. It
               was also at this time that Local 25 began a summer vacation resort for its members,
               an idea that would soon take off with the International and become Unity House. </div>
            <div class="para"> In 1920, Local 25 was the only local in New York for the waist and dress industry.
               The large size of the local made it difficult to properly control and adequately service
               all of the members. At the 1920 Convention, the General Executive Board enacted a
               resolution to establish a Joint Board within Local 25 and charter separate locals
               for dressmakers and waistmakers. By 1921, there was organized a Joint Board composed
               of Local 22 Dressmakers, Local 25 Waistmakers, Local 58 Waist Buttonhole Makers, Local
               60 Waist and Dress Pressers, Local 66 Bonnaz Embroidery Workers, Local 89 Italian
               Waist and Dressmakers, and the waist and dress branch of Cutters' Local 10. The new
               arrangement was not without problems among the recently rearranged locals. The new
               Dress and Waistmakers' Joint Board soon began new agreement negotiations with the
               Dress Manufacturers' Association, and called a general strike on February 9, 1921.
               Julius Hochman managed the Dress and Waistmakers' Joint Board. With a large growth
               of jobbers in the industry sending work to non-union shops, the Joint Board inaugurated
               a drive in the summer of 1922 to strike the big jobbing firms and bring workers under
               union contracts. A general work stoppage in February 1923 in the dress industry won
               the union a 40 hour week and 10 percent wage increase, as well as a large gain of
               new members. During the summer of 1923, after years of discussion and deliberation,
               the two dress locals, Local 23 and 22 were consolidated. The dressmakers from Local
               23 transferred to Local 22 and subsequently Local 22 joined the New York Cloakmakers'
               Joint Board. Later, the Dress Pressers' Local 60 joined Local 35 the Cloak Pressers'
               Union. Soon, the Dress and Waist Joint Board became unnecessary and was dissolved.
               Local 89, the Italian Dress and Waistmakers' Union, affiliated with the Cloak Board
               as well, and both dress and cloak industries in New York were represented by the Cloak
               and Dress Joint Board. Local 25 Waistmakers were left without an affiliated organization
               and in October 1924 merged with the Dressmakers' Union, Local 22. </div>
            <div class="para"> At the end of 1924, the Joint Board met with the Wholesale Dress Manufacturers' Association
               and although conferences continued into 1925, but resulted in the introduction of
               a sanitary label in the dress industry and an unemployment insurance fund. The "prosanis"
               label in the dress industry was launched by the Sanitary Joint Board on April 15,
               1925. During the remainder of 1925, many of the dress agreements went unenforced with
               the upsurge of workers in non-union plants and the internal conflict created by the
               rise to power of the Communists within the local. A "peace pact" resulted in the resignation
               of vice president Julius Hochman who had been managing the dress division, replaced
               by a staff of Communist officials headed by Charles Zimmerman. By the end of 1926,
               the Communists had gained control of the dress organization in New York City and the
               union barely existed. But during 1927 and 1928, the Joint Board persisted with organizing
               activities in an attempt to strengthen its position. Julius Hochman was elected general
               manager of the Joint Board and later in December 1927 Elias Reisberg was elected manager
               of the dress department. In 1929, the General Executive Board formed the Dress Trade
               Council consisting of representatives of dress locals to begin to rehabilitate the
               dress organization. Also at this time, Hochman was appointed manager of the Dress
               Division of the Joint Board and launched a large dress campaign to increase membership.
               Isidore Nagler served as general manager of Joint Board. </div>
            <div class="para"> In February 4, 1930, 25,000 dressmakers walked out of the shops. And while the strike
               was settled eight days later, the strike was called to reorganize dressmakers and
               establish collection relationships with employers and collective agreements as well
               as finally abolish the Communist influence in the industry. On April 8, 1930 the General
               Executive Board decided to separate the dressmakers from the Cloakmakers' Joint Board
               and give them back an autonomous joint board to govern their own affairs. The new
               independent Dress Joint Board addressed dress manufacturers list of 38 demands during
               contract negotiations, and when an agreement could not be reached, on February 16,
               1932, a general strike of the dressmakers lasted two weeks. This defensive strike
               renewed collective agreements. Another walkout in all dress shops, both union and
               non-union on August 16, 1933 brought the dress industry to a halt. A quick resolution
               resulted in 35 hours/5 day weeks, fixed wages for week and piece workers, and guaranteed
               minimum wages. By February 1934, the Dress Joint Board moved to new larger offices
               along with Locals 22 and 89, illustrating a drastic turnaround from previous years.
               The dress industry was now the biggest organized center in the ILGWU. </div>
            <div class="para"> The historic revival of the New York dress organization in 1933 created the largest
               single body of workers within the union. By the 1940s, the Dress Joint Board was composed
               of Locals 89 (Italian Dressmakers), 22, 60 (Dress Pressers) and the Dress Division
               of Cutters' Local 10. Added to that, in 1939 the Dress Joint Board took over responsibility
               for and control over the working conditions and agreements of silk dress production
               in the Eastern and the Cotton Dress Departments. The Joint Board worked to create
               a WPA sewing project for unemployed dressmakers, as well as establishing in 1938 a
               Samplemakers' Labor Bureau. Unfortunately, the lack of styles during the war years
               caused economic problems, with shrinking production and unemployment. With the collective
               agreement of March 1944, an industry-wide health and vacation fund covered members
               of Locals 89, 22 and 60 and included sick benefits, hospitalization, medical services
               at the Union Health Center, eye exams, and tuberculosis aid, as well as one week's
               paid vacation. Additionally, a retirement system supplemented the health and vacation
               fund, the Retirement Fund and Health and Welfare Fund of the Dress Joint Board. Soon,
               the dress industry was back to pre-war production levels with an increase in styles,
               though the industry often had difficulty adapting to the postwar retail market and
               new consumer attitude. The Joint Board launched a large scale organization drive at
               the end of the decade which was met with resistance, often violent, by "for hire"
               thugs interfering on picket lines and threatening Joint Board officers. Zimmerman,
               now a vice-president as well as manager of Local 22, supervised the drive to organize
               the open shops. It was during this drive that dress presser and temporary organizer
               William Lurye was murdered in May 1949 as the open shops employed racketeering to
               prevent unionization. The anti-open shop campaign succeeded in bringing union conditions
               and standards to the new shops. </div>
            <div class="para"> The New York Dress Institute was formed with the assistance of the Joint Board in
               1941 to promote American fashions and establish New York as the fashion capital. While
               the Joint Board suspended payments in 1944, the Institute still operated, having fashion
               shows, distributing fashion photographs for publications, and maintaining the best
               dressed women list. By 1953, the Dress Institute cut operation due to lack of funds
               and began operating as the Couture Group of the Dress Institute. At a GEB meeting
               in 1953, shipping clerks in the dress industry were unionized to form Local 60A, a
               branch of Local 60. The locals in Joint Board now included Locals 89, 22, and 60-60A
               Dress Pressers and Shipping Clerks. Julius Hochman resigned as manager of the Dress
               Joint Board in June 1958 after 29 years (since 1929) to direct the new ILGWU Union
               Label Department. He was succeeded by Charles Zimmerman, who had been manager of Local
               22 for 25 years. 1958 also saw the formation of the Dressmakers' Joint Council, which
               consisted of the Joint Board, as well as the dress sections of the Eastern Out-of-Town
               and Northeast Departments. Zimmerman was also manager of the new Joint Council. Sol
               Greene, assistant director of the Northeast Department, became the new assistant general
               manager of the Joint Board. The Joint Board in January 1959 was the first ILGWU affiliate
               to introduce the new union label. </div>
            <div class="para"> A March 1958 walkout of 105,000 dressmakers in the New York metropolitan area was
               the first general strike in 25 years. Negotiations with employers began at the end
               of 1957 and with no resolution in sight, the contracts, set to expire January 1958,
               were extended for another month. Again, with no agreement in sight, the strike committee
               set the date of March 5 for the walkout. At ten o'clock that morning, thousands and
               thousands of garment workers left the shops and made their way into the streets. Soon
               Madison Square Garden was filled and tens of thousands pickets organized. A few days
               later, Mayor Wagner called strike leaders and appointed from Senator Lehman and Impartial
               Chairman Harry Uviller to mediate the strike. The five day general strike resulted
               in a new contract for workers including wage increases, a 7 hour day/ 35 hour week
               for piece and time workers with overtime pay, and the establishment of a severance
               fund. </div>
            <div class="para"> The decades of the 1960s and 70s saw a decline in shops and jobs in New York City
               with firms going out of business. In June 1969, Local 38 Theatrical Costume, Ladies
               Tailors voted to affiliate with the Joint Board, representing theatrical costume workers
               and custom tailors in departments stores. Additional diversifying included a newly
               formed Local 159 of office employees in the dress industry. Charles Zimmerman retired
               on July 1, 1972 as union vice president and manager of the Dress Joint Council and
               New York Dress Joint Board. Murray Gross, who had been associate general manager since
               1969 became the general manager of the Joint Board and Joint Council. The Joint Board
               now consisted of Locals 89, 22, 60-60A and 159 along with the new Local 38 and 159.
               March 1974 saw the initial movement to reorganize the Joint Board by combining and
               merging various departments. By 1975, the New York Dress Joint Board completed restructuring
               of affiliate locals, and Locals 60-60A, 159, and 38 were merged into existing Locals
               22 and 89. Local 22 gained jurisdiction over all dressmakers in Manhattan and Local
               89 was designated the local for all Bronx and Brooklyn members. Vice president and
               general manager Murray Gross retired and Sam Nemaizer became manager after the 1974
               convention. There were changes in leadership also as Locals 22 and 89 saw long serving
               managers began to retire. </div>
            <div class="para"> In November 1977, the executive committee of the ILGWU General Executive Board enacted
               a resolution that merged the existing cloak, dress, rainwear and other affiliates
               in New York, thus ending the separate existence of the New York Cloak and Dress Joint
               Boards. The New York Cloak-Dress Joint Board and Affiliates consisted of Local 1-35
               United Coat, Suit, Rainwear and Allied Workers Union of Manhattan; Local 10 Cutters;
               Local 22 Dressmakers Union of Manhattan; Local 48 Coat, Suit, Dress, Rainwear and
               Allied Workers Union of North Brooklyn; Local 77 Coat, Suit, Dress, Rainwear and Allied
               Workers Union of Queens; Local 89 Coat, Suit, Dress, Rainwear and Allied Workers Union
               of South Brooklyn; and Local 189 Coat, Suit, Dress, Rainwear and Allied Workers Union
               of the Bronx. At the same time, sportswear locals previously under the Dress or Cloak
               Joint Board were now a part of the new New York Sportswear and Allied Workers Joint
               Board (Local 10 Cutters; Local 23-25 Blouse, Skirt and Sportswear Workers; Local 91
               Children's Dressmakers; Local 105 Snowsuit, Infants, and Novelty Sportswear; and Local
               155 Knitgoods Workers). The new resolution redrew existing locals' jurisdiction to
               represent workers along geographic as well as industrial lines. The changes created
               a more efficient and economical representation of the workers and provided greater
               organizing ability and bargaining power. E. Howard Molisani, an ILGWU vice-president
               and manager of the Cloak Joint Board, was elected to serve as the general manager
               of the new organization. Following his retirement in July 1978, Samuel Nemaizer (formerly
               manager of the Dress Joint Board) was appointed to succeed Molisani as general manager.

            <div class="para"> In late 1981, the Joint Board approved a measure to dissolve Locals 48, 77 and 189
               to create a stronger financial foundation for the organization. Members were transferred
               to Locals 22, 1-35 and 89. Local 89 was renamed Local 89- 48 to honor the historic
               significance of the Italian cloakmakers. An October 1984 meeting resulted in more
               restructuring of the board and locals into a new Local 89-22-1. Changes in the garment
               industry necessitated the dissolution of the Joint Board and Locals 22 and 89-48.
               The charter of Local 1-35 was amended to create the new Local 89-22-1. With the consolidation
               of staff and retirements of managers Samuel Nemaizer, Manuel Gonzalez and Frank Longo,
               Samuel Byer, associate general manager of the New York Coat-Dress-Rainwear Joint Board
               was elected manager of Local 89-22-1. The New York Sportswear Joint Board was renamed
               the New York Joint Board in August 1985, and Locals 62-32 and 66-40 joined the existing
               affiliates Locals 23-25, 155, 91-105 and 10 and managed by Edgar Romney. After the
               retirement in 1993 of Samuel Byer, Barbara Laufman was elected manager of Local 89-22-1.
               Local 89-22-1 was the successor to some of the oldest locals in the union from the
               coat, dress, suite and rainwear industries, as well as both the New York Dress and
               Cloak Joint Boards. In July 1922, the New York State District merged with Local 89-22-1.</div>  </a>

            <div class="para">The records of the Dress Joint Board are arranged alphabetically by subject and offer
               an overview of the function and type of work undertaken by the Joint Board within
               the dress industry. The Joint Board had far reaching interests and business, and the
               collection is predominantly correspondence arranged alphabetically by subject, revealing
               the breadth of organizations, commitments, and activities of the Joint Board. For
               instance, the records document the Joint Boards work with Civil Rights organizations,
               including the NAACP, Roy Wilkins, the National Urban League, and even correspondence
               with Martin Luther King Jr. There is material discussing the charges of discrimination
               levied by NAACP labor secretary Herbert Hill against the union in 1962, as well as
               late 1950s reports and correspondence of the unions work with the State Commission
               Against Discrimination. Dress associations represented in agreements include the United
               Better Dress Manufacturers, the Pennsylvania Dress Manufacturers Association, and
               the New Jersey Dress Manufacturers. Records show organizations the Joint Board contributed
               money. There is also much information on elections, mainly campaign material for congressional
               races as well as local elections (city council). The correspondence and literature
               comes from the Campaign Committee. Of particular note is the material for elections
               within the locals for executive board, for officers, including ballots and slates.
               </div>
            <div class="para"> The collection provides documentation on the dress industry, with material comprising
               price settlement lists, operator earnings, garment production volume/dollar volume,
               and wholesale firm production. There are many comparison studies, including a survey
               of wage rates by skill (draper, cutter, etc.). Additionally, there are facts, figures
               and reports from the Price Settlement Department, such as information on wage comparisons.
               The dispute between piece work and week work can be examined from the reports and
               studies on the introduction of section work and pricing in relation to the completed
               employee and shop week work questionnaires. </div>
            <div class="para"> The administrative function of the Joint Board is represented through reports to
               the General Executive Board; records of the Health, Welfare and Retirement plans/funds,
               which were established in 1944, and include rules and regulations, premiums, payments,
               reports, receipts and disbursements; disability benefits paid out with and without
               hearings; decisions of the Impartial Chairman. Another component of the collection
               is material from the locals that composed the Joint Board as well as dress locals
               not in New York City (out-of-town) and their Joint Boards. This includes much material
               from the Northeast Department, which in 1958, had the dress department merge with
               the Joint Board to form the new Dressmakers' Joint Council. A large section of the
               collection contains files on negotiations of the Joint Board with employers and manufacturing
               associations for new contracts and agreements. These are organized according to year
               and illustrate gains and losses for the union over time through collective bargaining.
               Notable inclusions within the negotiations are listed in the folder titles. </div>
            <div class="para"> General Managers of the Dress Joint Board are also represented through correspondence,
               memos, articles, reports, and mainly speeches. Longtime manager Julius Hochman has
               many folders of speeches he gave, arranged by year and convention, i.e. ILGWU, AFL,
               regional meetings, Workman's Circle Convention, Jewish Labor Committee. There are
               also speeches and correspondence of Charles Zimmerman, including during his time as
               president of the Jewish Labor Committee (1967-1971). </div>
            <div class="para"> The history of the Dress Joint Board was filled consolidations and mergers. Early
               history can be found in the form of a constitution when it was called the Joint Board
               of the Dress and Waistmakers' Union, as well as when it was merged into the Joint
               Board of the Cloak, Suit, Skirt, Dress and Reefer Makers' Union. Also beneficial for
               historical information on the Joint Board are the reports that were presented to the
               ILGWU conventionsonly brief reports appear in the official proceedings. Finally, of
               note, there is the Dress Joint Board newsletter "The Organizer" from 1933 chronicling
               the dressmaker strike, and worth noting, there is a folder of photographs, and while
               many are of activities of the Joint Board, much is of a personal nature and includes
               snapshots of families and children.</div>  </a>
