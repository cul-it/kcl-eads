            <div class="para">Arbitrator, mediator, employee and panel member of federal labor dispute and wage
               stabilization agencies. </div>
            <div class="para"> The National War Labor Board, a tri-partite body established in 1942 by President
               Franklin D. Roosevelt, was charged with acting as an arbitration board in labor-management
               dispute cases, thereby preventing work stoppages which might hinder the war effort.
               It was also responsible for determining wage adjustments in accordance with anti-inflationary
               wage stabilization criteria and policies. </div>
            <div class="para"> The Board was initially divided into twelve Regional Administrative Boards which
               handled both labor dispute settlement and wage stabilization functions for specific
               geographic regions. The National Board further decentralized in 1943, when it established
               special tri-partite commissions and panels to deal with particular industries on a
               national basis. </div>
            <div class="para"> The Wage Stabilization Board was created as a constituent division of the Economic
               Stabilization Agency by Executive Order 10161 of September 9, 1950, under the authority
               of the Defense Production Act of 1950, to control wages and salaries during the Korean
               War emergency period. An executive order of April 21, 1951 reestablished the Board
               with power to assist the president in settling industrial disputes. In July of 1952,
               the Board was reconstituted under legislative authority but stripped of its function
               in the area of labor disputes. Wage controls were suspended in February of 1953 and
               the Board was terminated the following April. The Board, while it functioned, was
               a tripartite body representing labor, industry and the public. To expedite its activities,
               regional offices were established, including that in New York.</div>  </a>
