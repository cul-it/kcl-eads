            <div class="para">Maximilian Sebastian-Hayes (May 25, 1866 -October 11, 1945) was born in a cabin at
               Havana, Huron County, Ohio. Hayes obtained his limited formal education in the rural
               schools of Huron County (1871-1881). </div>
            <div class="para"> While still in his teens, Hayes moved to Cleveland. There he worked on the Cleveland
               Press (1881-1890). At this time the young Hayes also obtained an apprenticeship with
               Typographical Union 53. He took an active part in the union and at one time or other
               held most of the offices both in the local union and in the Central Labor Union. Hayes
               also served as a delegate from Cleveland to AFL conventions. In 1903 the AFL elected
               Hayes as a delegate to the British Trade Union Congress in London, England, where
               his speech gained international attention. Eight years later (1911) Hayes ran for
               president of the AFL against Samuel Gompers. Although Gompers won, Hayes received
               one third of the votes. </div>
            <div class="para"> His interest in the organized labor movement led him to establish a newspaper to
               promote its cause. Thus, on January 31, 1891, Hayes became the founder-editor of the
               Cleveland Citizen the earliest extant local weekly newspaper in the United States
               to be dedicated to the movement. When he first started out, Hayes had a small, shabby
               office and thirty dollars in capital. Within four years, however, the Citizen had
               gained such wide recognition as a voice for the working classes that the American
               Federation of Labor felt compelled to establish The American Federationist or else
               acknowledge the Citizen as the official labor newspaper in the United States. </div>
            <div class="para">  A Populist newspaper until 1896, in that year it became the trade union organ of
               the Cleveland Federation of Labor, the local council of the American Federation of
               Labor. Hayes was its editor for almost fifty years, until incapacitated by illness
               in 1939. Under his editorship the Citizen dealt with the primary issues of labor including
               better working conditions, higher wages, and shorter hours. Hayes, himself, took the
               time to appear before legislative committees at Columbus to voice his support of legislation
               to improve the lot of the working man. </div>
            <div class="para"> Active in the Socialist movement too, Hayes belonged to the Populist Party (1890-1896)
               and the Socialist Labor Party (1897-1900) before joining the Socialist Party in 1900.
               He was a Socialist Party candidate for Congress in 1900 and for Secretary of State
               of Ohio in 1902. The Socialist Labor Party nominated him for Vice President of the
               United States at its National Convention at Rochester, New York (February 2, 1900).
               Hayes, however, resigned from the ticket a couple of months later when the Socialist
               Labor Party joined with the Social Democratic Party to form the Socialist Party. Subsequently
               chairman of the Executive committee of the National Labor Party (1919) his final campaign
               was in 1920 when he ran for the Vice President of the United States on the Farmer-Labor
               ticket. </div>
            <div class="para"> In Cleveland Hayes was a leader in Community affairs. In 1904, for example, Hayes
               and a group of Cleveland doctors and citizens formed the Anti-tuberculosis League
               in which he played an active part. In Ohio he was labor's representative on the Consumer's
               League of Ohio beginning in 1900. He served on the Metropolitan Housing Authority,
               1933-1937. In 1934 he was appointed to the State Adjustment Board (NRA). </div>
            <div class="para"> Hayes married Dora Schneider December 11, 1900. They had one child, a daughter, Maxine
               Elizabeth, who married A.I. Davey Jr. in 1931. Davey became editor of the Citizen
               when Max Hayes retired.</div>  </a>

            <div class="para">The papers of Max S. Hayes consist primarily of correspondence. Also included are
               newspaper clippings, an autograph book, and a typed copy of tributes to Hayes. They
               span the period 1891-1949 with the bulk period covering 1900-1928. </div>
            <div class="para"> Boxes 1-5 (1891-1949) consist mainly of correspondence. Many of the letters are from
               Hayes to his wife, Dora, and a few to their daughter Maxine. Also found here are letters
               to Hayes from numerous friends and associatesA.M. Simons (editor, The International
               Socialist Review) Henry L. Slobodin (of the Socialist Labor Party), and others. </div>
            <div class="para"> Box 6 contains newspaper clippings relating to Hayes, a few printed items, and an
               autograph book. Also included here is a copy (tvpewritten/52 pages) of tributes paid
               to Hayes at the Fiftieth Anniversary Dinner honoring his founding of the Cleveland
               Citizen-Cleveland, Ohio, February 1, 1941. </div>
            <div class="para"> The papers relate both to his personal life and to his work. Although many of Hayes'
               letters are to his wife, Dora, they offer not only a glimpse into his private life,
               but also into his life-long work in the local and national AFL and in the Socialist
               movement. For he frequently wrote to his wifewhen away from homeabout his opinions
               of particular speaking tours, his activities at conventions, </div>
            <div class="para"> or his current ideas and impressions. </div>
            <div class="para"> Correspondence.with other persons also relates to his activities in the labor and
               socialist movements. Socialist sentiments, American Federation of Labor affairs, and
               interest in the National Labor Party all appear in the letters to Hayes. Also found
               here are letters that touch on Hayes' civic work. In addition, there are letters to
               Mrs. Hayes from family and friends, plus a few from her to her husband.</div>  </a>
