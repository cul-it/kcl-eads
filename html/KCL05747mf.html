            <div class="para">Operation Dixie was the name given to the CIO's program to bring unionism to the South.
               Under the direction of Van A. Bittner, the vice-president of the United Steelworkers
               of America, the CIO's Southern Organizing Committee was established in May 1946. Supported
               by contributions from some forty affiliated unions, the Committee established programs
               in twelve states throughout the South. Operation Dixie attempted to organize workers
               in diverse industries, concentrating on the textile, wood products, chemical, oil
               and iron and steel industries and on the largest and most resistant employers in a
               given area. </div>
            <div class="para"> While its primary purpose was "organizing the unorganized," the Southern Organizing
               Committee also cooperated with the CIO's Political Action Committees and State CIOs
               or Industrial Union Councils which sought to attain the parent organizations goals
               through state and national legislation and electoral reform. </div>
            <div class="para"> Although by February 1947 324 new locals had been established, the Committee's work
               was plagued with a variety of problems. Among these were charges of communist sympathies;
               opposition by the Ku Klux Klan and others to the CIO policy of establishing racially
               integrated locals; lack of financial support; and employer opposition which included
               violence, intimidation and collusion with public authorities. In 1953, the Southern
               drive was reorganized and most of the work of developing and servicing locals was
               turned over to the affiliated unions at that time. </div>
            <div class="para"> Consists in large part of the records of the CIO Organizing Committee campaigns to
               organize workers in four southern states: North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee
               and Virginia. Records from the other states involved in the campaign are no longer
               in existence. </div>
            <div class="para"> In addition to procedural matters delineating the business, personnel and financial
               policies of the Organizing Committee, the CIO's objectives, priorities and approaches
               to organizing and negotiating are apparent in correspondence, printed matter and publicity
               materials. National, state and local political issues, jurisdictional questions, including
               relations between the AFL and the CIO, improved labor and living conditions and relations
               with other departments of the CIO, as well as with a variety of social reform and
               friends of labor groups are documented. Legal materials include NLRB documents concerning
               unfair labor practices, elections, etc. Organizers reports and membership records

            <div class="para">The "Operation Dixie" papers consist in large part of the records of the C.I.O. Organizing
               Committee campaigns in four southern states: North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee
               and Virginia. The papers are divided into eight series as follows: </div>
            <div class="para"> Series I: C.I.O. Organizing Committee. North Carolina, 1932-1958. </div>
            <div class="para"> Series II: C.I.O. Organizing Committee. South Carolina, 1941-1953. </div>
            <div class="para"> Series III: C.I.O. Organizing Committee. Tennessee, 1938-1953. </div>
            <div class="para"> Series IV: C.I.O. Organizing Committee. Virginia, 1937-1953. </div>
            <div class="para"> Series V: C.I.O. Organizing Committee. Lucy Randolph Mason, 1912-1954. </div>
            <div class="para"> Series VI: C.I.O. Political Action Committee. North Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia,
               1943-1954. </div>
            <div class="para"> Series VII: C.I.O. Publicity Department. North Carolina, 1946-1953. </div>
            <div class="para"> Series VIII: C.I.O. Industrial Union Councils. North Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia,
               1938-1954. </div>
            <div class="para"> Papers of the Organizing Committees, Publicity Department, Political Action Committees
               and Industrial Union Councils are arranged alphabetically by subject folder title.
               The reel list provides the title of each folder with inclusive dates for the contents.
               Many of the subject categories were established by the C.I.O. regional offices; others
               were added by the staff of the Manuscript Department of the William R. Perkins Library
               at Duke University in the process of integrating loose material. These records are
               frequently arranged under name of correspondent, organization or affiliate union.
               There are, however, some materials in each series that are collected under such general
               headings as "Correspondence", "Printed Material" and "Miscellaneous". Incoming and
               outgoing correspondence and related printed, typed and mimeographed items are interfiled
               in each folder in chronological order. The term printed material is loosely used in
               describing folder contents, and covers such varied items as collective bargaining
               agreements, petitions, membership records, flyers, research reports and newsletters
               produced and duplicated in a number of ways. </div>
            <div class="para"> Oversize materials are arranged separately at the end of each series. Most of the
               subject headings appearing in the oversize section duplicate those used in the alphabetical
               reel list. Included among these materials are posters, flyers, newsletters, and a
               few items of correspondence that accompanied printed items or unfilmed clippings.
               </div>
            <div class="para"> The Lucy Randolph Mason papers are arranged in seven categories, each of which is
               organized chronologically. These categories are correspondence, addresses, minutes,
               memoranda, miscellany, printed materials and volumes. </div>
            <div class="para"> The numbers in parentheses following names and folder titles in the series descriptions
               refer to the frame numbers of the microfilm edition and to the location of the material
               in the reel list. </div>
