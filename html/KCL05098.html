            <div class="para">The New York State Board of Mediation and Arbitration was requested by the Iron Moulders
               Union to make an inquiry into the cause of the dispute between the Moulders and the
               Acme Malleable Iron Works. The Board held a hearing in Buffalo on February 21, 1899,
               since it had been informed that a condition of lawlessness existed around the plant
               and extra police were needed to guard the plant. </div>
            <div class="para"> The strike, or lockout began when the union presented its demands for $2.25 a day
               for the men on day work and piece rates which would permit the men to earn at least
               $2.25 a day. Shortly after the demands were presented, the employer called the moulders
               together in the plant to tell them that he was discharging all union men because they
               were intimidating non-union men and causing trouble in the plant. The non-union men
               could continue working, however. Union and non-union men walked off the job. </div>
            <div class="para"> In the course of the hearings it became apparent that the men were unable to learn
               the price for the jobs they did until payday, that they felt the weights assigned
               by the foreman were not always accurate and that the foreman gave the better jobs
               to the men who paid him extra. Union members also believed that they were discriminated
               against. The foreman denied the charges against him.</div>  </a>
