            <div class="para">New York State United Teachers (NYSUT) was created in 1972 by the merger of the New
               York State Teachers Association (NYSTA) and the United Teachers of New York (UTNY).
               NYSTA had been affiliated with the National Education Association (NEA), and UTNY
               with the American Federation of Teachers (AFT). UTNY was the statewide organization
               whose United Federation of Teachers (UFT), led by Albert Shanker, was the predominant
               teachers' union in New York City. In joining with United Teachers and affiliating
               with the AFT, NYSUT also became a member union of the AFL-CIO. </div>
            <div class="para"> In 1976, NYSUT voted to disaffiliate with the NEA. Some locals left NYSUT and created
               the NYEA (New York Educators Association), which became the state affiliate for the
               NEA. In the early 1980s, NYEA changed its name to NEA-NY. </div>
            <div class="para"> NYEA/NEA- NY viewed association with the AFL-CIO's industrial unions as undermining
               the professional image and independence of teachers. The two organizations also differed
               strongly on aspects of the governance structure, particularly with respect to ethnic
               minority representation, with NYSUT opposed to mandatory minimums. The rivalry between
               NYSUT and NYEA/NEA-NY in organizing new locals expended a great deal of resources
               for both labor organizations. </div>
            <div class="para"> While competition with NYEA/NEA-NY was a constant focus of NYSUT's organizing efforts
               for teachers, NYSUT was also organizing college faculty members, nurses, and other
               non-teaching personnel. Once members were organized, NYSUT continued to advocate for
               teachers' and other workers' rights through contract support and legal services at
               the local level and political involvement at the state and federal levels, supporting
               candidates and legislation that protected funding, due process, and working conditions.
               </div>
            <div class="para"> NEA-N Y merged with NYSUT in 2006, by which time NYSUT had grown to more than half
               a million members, becoming the largest union in New York State.</div>  </a>

            <p></p>
            
            <div class="para">The Federation of Nurses and Health Professionals began in 1978 with an organizing
               drive at Lutheran Medical Center in Brooklyn, where nurses voted overwhelmingly to
               join the United Federation of Teachers, the NYC affiliate of New York State United
               Teachers (NYSUT); both teacher unions were affiliated with the American Federation
               of Teachers. The Federation of Nurses and Health Professionals was created as the
               AFT's umbrella organization for health care workers; within city limits, it was known
               as the Federation of Nurses/UFT. Operationally, the union shared the same organizing
               personnel and field infrastructure as NYSUT and UFT. The collection documents the
               major organizing drives (and sometimes strikes) at Lutheran Medical and other voluntary
               (private) hospitals, the Albany Visiting Nurses Association and other independent
               staffing agencies, Bellevue Hospital, and the municipal network of the NYC Health
               and Hospitals Corporation. Major areas of contention remained consistent regardless
               of the size or status of the facility: staffing levels, long hours, and their impact
               on patient care. Throughout a decade of profound challenges and changes to the health
               care system, from institutional mergers and reorganizations, to new professional requirements,
               to the sudden appearance and explosive growth of a strange new disease that came to
               be called AIDS, nurses and other health professionals had the backup of the organizing
               and research capabilities of NYSUT to help them find their way.</div>  </a>

            <div class="para">Files cover organizing activities from 1972 through 1989 by Federation of Nurses and
               Health Professionals, an affiliate of NYSUT, and its counterpart in New York City,
               Federation of Nurses UFT. This was the peak period of organizing activity for these
               AFT unions, concentrated mainly in the New York City and Long Island metropolitan
               area but also including some medical centers, nursing homes/rehabilitation centers,
               and independent visiting nurse service agencies as far flung as Plattsburgh, Rochester,
               and Buffalo. Also included are materials by FNHP's main competitor, the New York State
               Nurses Association. Content of files comprise contract agreements, NLRB election decisions,
               recruiting materials by the medical facilities, organizing materials by the unions,
               anti-union correspondence by management, salary and benefit information, financial
               filings, opinion surveys, and also materials dealing with important nursing issues
               of the day, especially caring for the AIDS patient, dealing with the nursing shortage,
               licensing requirements, and the advent of the nurse practitioner.</div>  </a>
