            <div class="para">The Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, the most significant union representing
               workers in the men's clothing industry, was founded in New York City in 1914 as a
               breakaway movement from the United Garment Workers. Radical and immigrant workers
               in the tailors' and cutters' locals were the core of the seceding group, which advocated
               industrial unionism and economic strikes in opposition to the UGW's craft organization,
               which they saw as conservative and timid. Their diverging views had come to the fore
               during the historic 1910 dispute at the Chicago firm Hart, Schaffner, and Marx. The
               opposition called the strike against the UGW leadership's advice, and reached a path-breaking
               agreement with management that established an arbitration system to settle disputes.
               </div>
            <div class="para"> Members flocked to the new union. Around 50,000 strong at its founding, by 1920 the
               ACWA counted about 170,000 members. Initially composed mostly of immigrants of Jewish
               European descent with Socialist leanings, the ACWA quickly welcomed members of a great
               number of nationalities and diverse backgrounds. Like in other garment unions, most
               workers and many members were women, but the leadership was predominantly male, a
               situation that did not change for many decades. Early on the union adopted a centralized
               administrative structure combined with industrial unionism, with the joint boards'
               by-laws having precedence over those of locals. </div>
            <div class="para"> Espousing a philosophy perhaps brought over by its early immigrant socialist members,
               the Amalgamated went beyond bread and butter issues and adopted a distinctive form
               of social unionism that was largely absent in the American labor movement. Starting
               in the 1920s, it provided educational opportunities and recreational facilities for
               its members, as well as services such as an insurance plan, banks offering personal
               loans at low interest rates, low-cost housing cooperatives, medical clinics, and even
               union-owned restaurants. </div>
            <div class="para"> Sidney Hillman was the first president of the new union and the most important officer
               in its history. He applied his experience as bargaining representative in Chicago
               to the whole industry. Under his leadership the union made significant strides in
               securing better wages and working conditions for its members, and at the same time
               it consolidated gains and provided stability to the industry through the widespread
               adoption of the arbitration system tested at Hart, Schaffner, and Marx. Hillman paid
               close attention to industry issues, such as production, pricing, and marketing. In
               order to help management meet the competition of non-union firms, the union conducted
               studies of efficiency, work methods, and factory costs. Letters to the official publication
               of the union, Advance, document the controversy that ensued within the union over
               what was perceived to be collaboration with management. </div>
            <div class="para"> Hillman also understood the importance of labor's involvement in national affairs
               and political action. In the 1920s the ACWA sent delegates to the Conference for Progressive
               Political Action and to the Farmer-labor party conventions. Although many members
               and officers were Socialists, the union stopped short of officially endorsing the
               party. Communist attempts at gaining influence within the union were firmly curbed.
               Hillman's participation in national affairs and politics became prominent during the
               New Deal, when he became a close advisor to Franklin D. Roosevelt on labor and economic
               issues. He also served on the board of the National Recovery Administration. Later,
               during World War II, he helped establish the Labor's Non Partisan League. He was also
               named associate director of the Office of Production Management, which assisted in
               mobilizing the nation's resources for the war effort. Hillman's prestige perhaps reflected
               the healthy condition of his union, which by the end of the conflict was strong and
               stable. </div>
            <div class="para"> During the post World War II period the union faced a number of significant challenges.
               Membership continued to grow (peaking at 395,000 in 1968), but the union's political
               influence and visibility in national affairs declined. In their never ending pursuit
               of lower production costs, many firms relocated to the South, forcing the union to
               engage in large organizing efforts. Simultaneously, signs began to appear of changes
               that would lead to the almost complete demise of the domestic apparel industry and,
               ultimately, to the erosion of union membership. Foreign imports of cheap clothing
               goods steadily grew in the 1950s and 1960s, and mushroomed in the following two decades,
               plunging employment in the apparel sector into a steady decline. Union efforts to
               stem the tide included Buy American campaigns and extensive lobbying in Congress,
               but they were to no avail. In 1976, the ACWA merged with the Textile Workers of America
               to become the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union. Despite successful and
               much publicized nationwide actions such as the Farah boycott and the J.P. Stevens
               corporate campaign, the woes threatening the union's existence continued unabated.
               The fate of the domestic industry was sealed in the late 1970s and the 1980s by the
               flight of firms chasing tax breaks and cheap labor abroad. By 1995, when ACTWU voted
               to merge with the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union, their combined membership
               was 350,000. The new Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees (UNITE!)
               seemed poised to infuse new life in a troubled union.</div>  </a>
