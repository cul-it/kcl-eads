            <div class="para">The ILGWU was formed on June 3, 1900, by eleven delegates representing local unions
               from the major garment centers in New York City, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Newark.
               These local unions' memberships numbered about two thousand workers and were comprised
               primarily of Jewish immigrants, many of them socialist, who had recently arrived in
               the United States from Eastern Europe. Many had been active trade unionists before
               coming to America, and in some instances, had participated in or organized unions
               upon arrival.
               Seven local unions were represented at the International's founding meeting, and their
               delegates agreed that the efforts to improve working conditions within their cities
               would benefit from a national organization of workers in the ladies' garment trade.
               They agreed to name the new organization the International Ladies' Garment Workers'
               Union, and that it would affiliate with the American Federation of Labor. At the founding
               meeting, Herman Grossman was elected the first president of the ILGWU, and Bernard
               Braff was elected the first secretary-treasurer.
               The ILGWU chartered only four of the seven local unions at the founding meeting -
               the Cloak Makers' Union of New York Local No. 1, the Cloak Makers' Protective Union
               of Philadelphia Local No. 2, the United Cloak Pressers of Philadelphia Local No. 3,
               and the Cloak Makers' Union of Baltimore, Local No. 4. Soon after, local unions in
               Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, Kalamazoo (Michigan), and San Francisco were
               organized. According to Louis Levine, "The life of the locals during these early years
               was a succession of shop strikes, of propaganda and shop meetings, of injunctions
               fought (the most important of which was that against the cloakmakers' local of Racine,
               Wisconsin). The work of the International consists chiefly in trying to get the locals
               to join it, in smoothing out differences between locals in the same city, in helping
               to organize district councils and joint boards, in settling jurisdictional disputes,
               in enforcing boycotts and in agitating for its label.</div>  </a>
