            <div class="para">For Evelyn Dubrow, a prominent labor lobbyist, activism ran in the family. "Evy" was
               born May 6, 1911 in Passaic, New Jersey, to socialist parents who emigrated from Russia
               (Belarus). Her father was a carpenter and active union member, and after arriving
               in the United States in 1896, sent for Dubrow's mother and older sister Mary. It was
               her sister Mary though, a suffragist arrested for picketing the White House, who especially
               influenced Dubrow's interest in labor and liberal causes. </div>
            <div class="para"> Dubrow received a degree in journalism from New York University, and in the mid-1930s
               launched her career doing backup work for a friend who was a reporter at the Paterson
               Morning Call. She later began editing and writing an English section for The Citizen,
               an Italian-American weekly, and joined the American Newspaper Guild (ANG) in 1935,
               becoming secretary of the New Jersey organization from 1943 to 1946. Becoming interested
               in politics and political campaigns, Dubrow was hired by Police Commissioner Don Regner
               to do his press work and soon earned the nickname "Dynamite." In 1937, Dubrow became
               an assistant secretary for the Textile Worker's Organizing Committee. During her time
               there, she worked as an organizer and assistant to the Assistant Regional Director
               for the Textile Workers in New Jersey, Irving Abramson. After organizing young salesgirls
               in a Passaic department store, Dubrow orchestrated a successful sit-down strike after
               management refused to recognize the salesgirls' intent to unionize. Her previous experience
               with New Jersey politics came in handy when Commissioner Regner arrived to suppress
               the strike only to learn it was "Dynamite" leading the charge and a contract was soon
               signed. When Abramson was elected president, Dubrow became his chief assistant and
               edited the CIO newspaper. Throughout the 1940s, Dubrow held many positions including
               education director of the New Jersey Textile Workers Union (1940-1942), and secretary
               to the president of the New Jersey Industrial Union Council (1943) before becoming
               assistant to the president (1944). Dubrow also aided in the establishment of labor
               and industrial schools, including Rutgers University in 1947. Shortly after, Dubrow
               began to help organize the Americans for Democratic Action (ADA) and became New York
               State director for the ADA in 1948 where she also took part in political campaigning.
               </div>
            <div class="para"> Dubrow's early experience in lobbying the New Jersey legislature proved useful when
               in 1956, she went to work for the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU)
               as executive secretary of the Political Department. ILGWU President David Dubinsky
               believed it was important for the union to have a voice in Washington, D.C. and felt
               Dubrow was the right one to represent all of the "girl" members. So at the president's
               behest and after only six months on the job, in October of 1956, Dubrow headed to
               D.C. where she would become a fixture on Capitol Hill for the next forty years. In
               1961 she became the legislative representative for the ILGWU and elected a vice president
               of the union in 1977. While the voice for the garment workers and members of her union,
               throughout her career she also became a formidable voice for social legislation as
               well as labor. During her time in Washington, Dubrow wore out many pairs of shoes
               as she covered ground with such social issues as the minimum wage, civil rights, voting
               rights, occupational safety and health, health care reform, family and medical leave,
               fair trade, and the improvement of labor conditions for working families. Dubrow was
               very active in associations; a founding member of the National Consumers Federation
               of America, vice chairman of the Labor Advisory Council Office of Economic Opportunity,
               vice president of the Coalition of Trade Union Women and member of many organizations
               from the National Consumers League, the National Fair Representation Committee, New
               Jersey State Education Advisory Committee, and American Labor Education Service. </div>
            <div class="para"> Her ubiquity in Washington was evidenced through the stories of Dubrow's early babysitting
               activities with young charges including former Vice President Al Gore and Senator
               Christopher J. Dodd. Her respect in Washington was evidenced by the assigning of a
               doorkeepers' chair outside the House of Representatives chambers by then Speaker Thomas
               P. "Tip" O'Neill so she would not have to stand all day as she waited to catch Representatives
               entering and exiting the House. Dubrow's job as Legislative Representative and Executive
               Secretary of the Political Department of the ILGWU continued after the union's merger
               with the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers of America in 1995 that created
               the Union of Needletrades, Industrial, and Textile Employees (UNITE). She finally
               retired in 1997 and became Special Assistant to the then President of UNITE, Jay Mazur.
               In August of 1999, Dubrow was one of ten individuals, including former Presidents
               Ford and Carter, awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Clinton. Evelyn
               Dubrow passed away on June 20, 2006 at the age of 95.</div>  </a>
