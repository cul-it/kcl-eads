            <div class="para">Founded in 1900 by local union delegates representing about 2,000 members in cities
               in the northeastern United States, the ILGWU grew in geographical scope, membership
               size, political influence to become one of the most powerful forces in American organized
               labor by mid-century. Representing workers in the women's garment industry, the ILGWU
               worked to improve working and living conditions of its members through collective
               bargaining agreements, training programs, health care facilities, cooperative housing,
               educational opportunities, and other efforts. In 1995, the ILGWU merged with the Amalgamated
               Clothing and Textile Workers Union (ACTWU) to form the Union of Needletrades, Industrial
               and Textile Employees (UNITE).</div>  </a>

            <div class="para">Mabel Durham Fuller was born on April 1, 1905 in Kingston, New York, where she attended
               the local public schools of Kingston and Yonkers. She was an operator in an undergarment
               factory before the shop was unionized, and after it was organized, Fuller became the
               shop chairlady. She was a member of the Undergarment and Negligee Workers Union, Local
               62 and elected to the Executive Board in 1937. As a member of the Board, Fuller served
               on the Finance Committee and Sick Benefit Committee. She was also elected as a delegate
               to attend several ILGWU National Conventions. Fuller attended the Hudson Shore Labor
               School, as well as the U.S. Army Administration school from 1944-1945, and was the
               first woman to attend the Harvard Trade Union Institute where she was a fellow from
               1945-1946. Fuller became the first African American staff member of the Education
               Department in 1946. In the Education Department, Fuller helped to plan and direct
               programs that aimed at improving the image of the union not only to the members, but
               also to the public. </div>
            <div class="para"> Fuller was an American National Red Cross instructor, chair of the Women's Service
               Brigade during World War II, delegate to the Negro Labor Committee, member of the
               Committee for Civil Rights, the Urban League, the NAACP, and the Liberal Party.</div>  </a>

            <div class="para">The collection contains an oral history interview on two cassette tapes conducted
               by P. Sinclair on February 22, 1988. The first cassette tape deals with the history
               of Lapala, New York, an integrated town which no longer exists and where Fuller spent
               her early years. In the second cassette tape, Fuller provides an overview of her work
               history, including her first job, the general strike of 1933, and working in the Education
               Department of Local 62.</div>  </a>
