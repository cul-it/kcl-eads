            <div class="para">The Order of Railway Conductors and Brakemen [ORC] was founded in 1868 as an order
               of railroad conductors and later expanded to include brakemen. </div>
            <div class="para"> The Order of Railway Conductors and Brakemen was founded in 1868 in Amboy, Illinois
               as the Conductors Union. Initially, it was a fraternal benefit society, but by 1890
               it had adopted a policy of engaging in labor negotiations on behalf of its members
               as well as permitting its members to strike. The name was changed to Order of Railway
               Conductors of America in 1878. In 1942, the Order of Sleeping Car Conductors merged
               with ORC. The union's name was changed in 1954 to the Order of Railway Conductors
               and Brakemen to reflect its changing membership. The ORC International Headquarters,
               Grand Division, was located in Cedar Rapids, Iowa with subordinate divisions in the
               United States, Canada, and the Panama Canal Zone. In 1969, the Order merged with the
               Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen, Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen,
               and Switchmen's Union of North America to form the United Transportation Union. </div>
            <div class="para"> Local Division 642 was one of the subordinate divisions of the ORC. It was located
               in West Springfield, Massachusetts; its members were employees of the Boston and Albany
               Railroad. These employees were split into two divisions, the Boston Division and the
               Albany Division, each division working the 100-mile stretch from Springfield to either
               terminal point.</div>  </a>

            <div class="para"> This collection consists of a selection of records produced by ORC Local 642. The
               records are primarily concerned with dues, both owed and paid, and assessments of
               the Local and its members by the Grand Division in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Also present
               in this collection is correspondence between the Grand Division and Local 642, ORC
               circulars from their 40th Anniversary (1948), and remittance forms. Of note are the
               quarterly rosters listing the names of all members of Local 642 and, in the case of
               the roster produced by the Grand Division, local addresses of the union members. The
               rosters produced by the local division include the names of its members and they dues
               they had or had not paid.</div>  </a>
