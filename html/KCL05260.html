            <div class="para">James J. Murphy was born in New York city in 1860. He attended the College of the
               City of New York for a brief period, but left to become a printer. In 1883 he joined
               Local 6, and in 1885 married Miss Abbe Pogarty, daughter of a long time member of
               Local 6 and a compositor herself. His brother, the Reverend William G. Murphy, attended
               the American College in Rome, where he was made vice-rector in 1903. </div>
            <div class="para"> Murphy served as vice president of Local Six from 1891 to 1893 and as president from
               1893 to 1896. In 1896 a resolution of the international called for the institution
               of the nine hour day in book and job shops, and created a committee of five to lead
               the Union toward this goal. Murphy was named chairman of this Shorter Work Week Committee.
               The New York Typothetae signed an agreement in December </div>
            <div class="para"> of 1887, which provided for a nine-and-a-half hour day and a nine hour day on Saturday
               as of January 1, 1898. </div>
            <div class="para"> Continued agitation by Murphy and his committee led the United Typothetae to call
               a general meeting of printing trades unions in October 1898 at Syracuse. An agreement
               was signed with the Int'l Typographical Union, the International Printing Pressmen
               and Assistants Union and the International Brotherhood of Bookbinders. The nine and
               a half hour day was to be instituted on November 21, 1898 and the nine hour day was
               to become standard in book and job shops on November 21, 1899. </div>
            <div class="para"> In 1902 the International began working for a reduction of working hours to eight
               each day, leaving "eight for recreation and improvement of mind, eight for eating
               and sleeping." A resolution approved by the 1904 convention demanded that the eight
               hour day become standard in all book and job shops on January 1, 1906. Strikes against
               the Typothetae were stopped by court injunction and the union finally settled for
               a forty-eight-hour week with a half day on Saturday. </div>
            <div class="para"> Murphy was then re-elected as President of Local Six and served until 1908. In 1908
               he passed the New York State Civil Service examination for </div>
            <div class="para"> Supervising Factory Inspector. He was demoted to-Factory Inspector in 1916, because
               of a shortage of funds, but was reinstated in 1919 and held the position until he
               died on June 10, 1922.</div>  </a>

            <p></p>
            
            <div class="para">While the association of typographical workers in a particular shop as chapels for
               mutual benefit is almost as old as printing itself, modern trade unions did not occur
               until the late 1840's. In January of 1850 the New York Printers Union was founded,
               with Horace Greeley, editor of the Tribune, as president. In Kay of 1852 representatives
               of the New York union met with members of other typographical unions to found the
               National Typographical Union which was renamed the International Typographical Union
               in 1869. The New York Printers' Union received a charter from the National Typographical
               Union as Typographical Union #6. </div>
            <div class="para"> In 1862 Local Six began pressing for a shorter work day, which led to the formation
               of the New York Typothetae, an organization of "Master Printers," designed to counteract
               the growing strength of the union. In 1887, a similar demand by the International
               Union brought about the association of the Typothetae in several cities into the United
               Typothetae of America. This organization continued to block the International's efforts
               to reduce working hours in the book and job shops until 1897, although the use of
               labor saving machinery made the eight hour, six day week standard in newspaper shops.</div>  </a>
