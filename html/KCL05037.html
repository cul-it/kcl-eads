            <div class="para">An Executive order of the President dated February 24, 1950 resulted in the appointment
               of a board composed of Hon. Roger I. McDonough, justice, Supreme Court of Utah, Chairman,
               Hon. Mart J. O'Malley former justice, Supreme Court of Indiana; and Professor Gordon
               S. Watkins, University of California. Public hearings were held in Chicago, Illinois,
               beginning March 2, 1950, through May 9, 1950 the record consisting of 49 volumes of
               8,385 pages, and 143 exhibits. </div>
            <div class="para"> Upon stipulation of the parties and approval of the President, two extensions of
               time were granted, allowing to June 15, 1950, for rendition of the Board's report
               to the President. </div>
            <div class="para"> The emergency precipitating the establishment of this- board resulted from the announced
               intention of the employees represented by the two organizations, to withdraw from
               the service of the railroads represented by the Carriers' Conference Committees, in
               connection with their demands for proposed new rules and changes in existing rules
               governing working conditions affecting primarily conductors, trainmen, yard service
               employees, and certain dining car and other groups of employees, altogether about
               180,000 employees of the nation's major railroads. </div>
            <div class="para"> The issues were numerous and complex, involving such matters as the 40-hour workweek;
               differentials for car retarder operators, footboard yardmasters, and baggage-men handling
               United States mail; graduated rate of pay tables in all classes of service; the restoration
               of the standard wage rates between territories; and modification of other rules. Also
               involved were carriers' proposals to change pay provisions, rules, regulations, interpretations,
               and practices pertaining to the 40-hour workweek (if recommended) interdivisional,
               and intradivisional runs; pooling of cabooses; switching limits; and numerous other
               proposals. </div>
            <div class="para"> On June 15, 1950, the board made its report to the President, recommending a 5-day,
               40-hour basic workweek for railroad yard service employees, with an increase in basic
               rates of pay of 18 cents per hour, effective October 1, 1950. Upward adjustments in
               rates of pay for car retarder operators, footboard yardmasters and baggagemen handling
               United States mail were also recommended. The board recommended the withdrawal of
               a number of other proposals of the organizations, including one which called for a
               graduated basis of pay for road conductors and trainmen. The board also recommended
               against the establishment of a 100-mile, 5-hour basic day in passenger service to
               replace the 150-mile, 7 1/2-hour basic day. Among the changes in rules proposed by
               the railroads, the board recommended that the carriers and the organizations negotiate
               revisions in rules to permit interdivisional runs, pooling of cabooses, and changes
               in yard switching limits; redefinition of rules covering coupling and uncoupling air
               hoses; inclusion of a rule covering rate of pay for work performed in more than one
               class of service in a tour of duty, and change in reporting for duty rules. It recommended
               the withdrawal of other carrier proposed rules changes. </div>
            <div class="para"> During the course of the hearings in this case, two additional disputes on similar
               issues were referred to this same board by the President. (See Emergency Boards Nos.
               83 and 84).</div>  </a>
