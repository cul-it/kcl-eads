            <div class="para">The Amalgamated Association of Street and Electric Railway Employees of America union
               was founded in September of 1892. The union was intended to represent employees of
               the transit industry and be international, initially focusing on the east coast of
               the United States and Canada. The objectives of the union included settlement of disputes
               with management, securing fair compensation and good working conditions also education
               for workers. Although the union participated in strikes by the start of the 20th century
               the union became much more militant in its efforts. During these strikes the public
               and small business often sympathized with the streetcar employees. Nowadays the Amalgamated
               Transit Union is the largest labor organization representing transit workers in the
               United States and Canada. The union has over 190,000 members across 46 states and
               9 provinces. The ATU represents operators of buses, vans, subway trains, and light
               rail. Additionally clerks, baggage handlers, maintenance workers and others are also
               represented by ATU. There are currently 220 local unions in North America with Chicago
               being Division 241.</div>  </a>
