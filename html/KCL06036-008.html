            <div class="para">Founded in 1900 by local union delegates representing about 2,000 members in cities
               in the northeastern United States, the ILGWU grew in geographical scope, membership
               size, political influence to become one of the most powerful forces in American organized
               labor by mid-century. Representing workers in the women's garment industry, the ILGWU
               worked to improve working and living conditions of its members through collective
               bargaining agreements, training programs, health care facilities, cooperative housing,
               educational opportunities, and other efforts. In 1995, the ILGWU merged with the Amalgamated
               Clothing and Textile Workers Union (ACTWU) to form the Union of Needletrades, Industrial
               and Textile Employees (UNITE).</div>  </a>

            <div class="para">Pauline Newman was born in Lithuania around 1890 and came to the United States in
               1901 with her mother and sisters after the death of her father. Shortly after her
               arrival, she went to work to help support her family. After working in various factories,
               Newman became employed at the Triangle Shirtwaist Co. factory. Newman was involved
               in the 1909 Shirtwaist Makers' Strike and following the strike, became the first woman
               organizer for the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union, traveling through
               the Midwest and Northeast. By the time of the 1911 Triangle Fire, she was no longer
               employed at the factory, but many of her former coworkers perished in the fire and
               Newman marked the anniversary of the tragedy every year. In 1914, she served on the
               Joint Board of Sanitary Control in New York City, which was a combined trade union
               and manufacturers' unit designed to establish standards for maintaining sanitary conditions
               in the shops. From 1918 to her retirement, Newman was the director of education for
               the Union Health Center. As health educator, she arranged for lectures and programs,
               created an innovative preventive health care program, and served as a liaison between
               the medical staff and the local unions. Newman often spoke on behalf of workers' health
               care before city, state and federal government panels. </div>
            <div class="para"> Additionally, Newman was a member and officer of numerous labor and civic organizations,
               including the Women's Trade Union League, United Nations Commission on the Status
               of Women, the advisory committee of the U.S. Department of Labor's Women's Bureau,
               the New York State Commission on enforcing equal pay law, and the New York State Department
               of Labor's Minimum Wage Board. She died in 1986 at the age of 96.</div>  </a>

            <div class="para">The collection consists of Pauline Newman's autobiography in the form of a letter
               addressed to Michael and Hugh in which she recounts stories and details of her life
               while she is on board a ship heading to Switzerland to attend a meeting of the International
               Labor Organization. In her recollections, Newman begins with her childhood and village
               life in Lithuania and discusses immigrating to the U.S. after the death of her father
               in 1901. She vividly details the difficult trip across the Atlantic and the conditions
               for new immigrants upon arrival in New York. Newman writes about her early employment
               experiences in various factories before ultimately finding work in the garment industry.
               Of particular interest are the passages in which she describes her employment at the
               Triangle Shirtwaist Company, including the inhuman working conditions in the factory,
               the long hours, and the little pay. Newman also spends time discussing her activities
               outside the ILGWU, including her involvement in the Socialist Party and the Socialist
               Literary Society. She provides a first-hand account of the Shirtwaist Makers' Strike
               of 1909 and her subsequent work with the ILGWU, including her organizing trips and
               assignments across the country.</div>  </a>
