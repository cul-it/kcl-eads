            <div class="para">William Thaw Sr. (October 12, 1818 – August 17, 1889) was an American businessman
               who made his fortune in transportation and banking.
               He worked as a clerk in his father's United States Bank of Philadelphia in Pittsburgh.
               He later switched to McKee, Clark and Co.
               By 1842, he and his brother-in-law Thomas Shields Clarke owned steam canal boats,
               particularly the Pennsylvania and Ohio line. Their company added canal, portage railroad
               and other steamboat lines.
               With the rise of the railroad, Thaw divested the canal business and invested in the
               new Pennsylvania Company, which managed interests of the Pennsylvania Railroad, in
               which he was a large shareholder.</div>
            <div class="para">Thomas Alexander Scott (December 28, 1823 – May 21, 1881) was an American businessman,
               railroad executive, and industrialist. In 1861, President Abraham Lincoln appointed
               him to serve as U.S. Assistant Secretary of War, and during the American Civil War
               railroads under his leadership played a major role in the war effort. He became the
               fourth president of the Pennsylvania Railroad (1874–1880), which became the largest
               publicly traded corporation in the world and received much criticism for his conduct
               in the Great Railroad Strike of 1877 and as a "robber baron." Scott helped negotiate
               the Republican Party's Compromise of 1877 with the Democratic Party; it settled the
               disputed presidential election of 1876 in favor of Rutherford B. Hayes in exchange
               for the federal government pulling out its military forces from the South and ending
               the Reconstruction era. In his final years, Scott made large donations to the University
               of Pennsylvania.</div>  </a>
