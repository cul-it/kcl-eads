            <div class="para">New York State United Teachers (NYSUT) was created in 1972 by the merger of the New
               York State Teachers Association (NYSTA) and the United Teachers of New York (UTNY).
               NYSTA had been affiliated with the National Education Association (NEA), and UTNY
               with the American Federation of Teachers (AFT). UTNY was the statewide organization
               whose United Federation of Teachers (UFT), led by Albert Shanker, was the predominant
               teachers' union in New York City. In joining with United Teachers and affiliating
               with the AFT, NYSUT also became a member union of the AFL-CIO. </div>
            <div class="para"> In 1976, NYSUT voted to disaffiliate with the NEA. Some locals left NYSUT and created
               the NYEA (New York Educators Association), which became the state affiliate for the
               NEA. In the early 1980s, NYEA changed its name to NEA-NY. </div>
            <div class="para"> NYEA/NEA-NY viewed association with the AFL-CIO's industrial unions as undermining
               the professional image and independence of teachers. The two organizations also differed
               strongly on aspects of the governance structure, particularly with respect to ethnic
               minority representation, with NYSUT opposed to mandatory minimums. The rivalry between
               NYSUT and NYEA/NEA-NY in organizing new locals expended a great deal of resources
               for both labor organizations. </div>
            <div class="para"> While competition with NYEA/NEA-NY was a constant focus of NYSUT's organizing efforts
               for teachers, NYSUT was also organizing college faculty members, nurses, and other
               non-teaching personnel. Once members were organized, NYSUT continued to advocate for
               teachers' and other workers' rights through contract support and legal services at
               the local level and political involvement at the state and federal levels, supporting
               candidates and legislation that protected funding, due process, and working conditions.
               </div>
            <div class="para"> NEA-N Y merged with NYSUT in 2006, by which time NYSUT had grown to more than half
               a million members, becoming the largest union in New York State.</div>  </a>

            <div class="para">The Vice President's Office directs NYSUT's initiatives on educational policy and
               is its frontline advocate to the New York State Board of Regents and the State Education
               Department. </div>
            <div class="para"> The Vice President's Office oversees the Division of Research and Educational Services,
               created in 1974, and the Education and Learning Trust (called the Effective Teaching
               Program until 2005), NYSUT's professional development arm. </div>
            <div class="para"> Maria Neira was elected First Vice President in 2005 after serving as Second Vice
               President for six months; she succeeded Antonia Cortese, who had been First Vice President
               since 1985 after serving as Second Vice President since 1973. Cortese left NYSUT in
               2004 to become executive vice president of the American Federation of Teachers (AFT).
               Maria Neira also serves as a vice president of the AFT. </div>
            <div class="para"> In 2007, the titles First Vice President and Second Vice President were changed simply
               to Vice President, with the duties of each carried over to the officers who held the
               former respective positions. Maria Neira remains the director of the divisions and
               programs traditionally under the first vice president's purview, and also coordinates
               NYSUT's fundraising activities for the American Cancer Society. </div>
            <div class="para"> Vice President Kathleen Donahue, elected second vice president in 2005, oversees
               Program Services, which addresses the needs of NYSUT's health care professionals,
               members of small and rural locals, new members and retirees. It also provides training
               in workplace health and safety issues.</div>  </a>
