            <div class="para">The Northern Pacific Railway Company [NP] built the Staples Station in 1909. It was
               designed by the same architectural firm, Reed and Stem, which designed the NP's King
               Street Station in Seattle, Washington and New York's Grand Central Terminal. The Staples
               depot and freight house were added to the National Register of Historic Places in
               1985. </div>
            <div class="para"> The Staples Station served as a division point for the NP. As such, in additon to
               the passenger areas in the depot, the building housed office space for the trainmaster,
               superintendant, and other NP personnel who were responsible for overseeing NP operations
               in the neighboring train yards. The yards included a freight house, a round house,
               and repair in place tracks. Serving as a division point also meant that the Staples
               Station was where train crews would start and end their shifts, or even use overnight
               facilities provided for employees. </div>
            <div class="para"> Due to its position as a division point, the correspondence of the trainmaster A.
               W. McClelland covers a wide variety of topics related to running a well-functioning
               train yard and station.</div>  </a>

            <div class="para"> This collection consists of the correspondence of Austin W. McClelland, the trainmaster
               for the Northern Pacific Railway Company's Staples Station in Staples, Minnesota.
               The correspondence dates from 1918. There are three pieces of correspondence that
               are not from this year, one letter from 1925 and two reports from 1931. </div>
            <div class="para"> The correpsondence offers an intimate view into the daily operations of a train yard.
               The telegrams and letters cover everything from reporting trains running late, to
               repairs made to trains in the yard, to personal thanks from passengers, to freight
               bills, to disciplinary notices, and to employees asking for days off or telegraphing
               out sick. </div>
            <div class="para"> Of note is a piece of correspondence from W. G. McAdoo, director general of railroads,
               dated March 22, 1918 regarding the nationalization of all railroads as part of the
               war mobilization. </div>
