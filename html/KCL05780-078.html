            <div class="para">The International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union was once one of the largest labor
               unions in the United States founded in 1900 by local union delegates representing
               about 2,000 members in cities in the northeastern United States. It was one of the
               first U.S. Unions to have a membership consisting of mostly females, and it played
               a key role in the labor history of the 1920s and 1930s. The union is generally referred
               to as the "ILGWU" or the "ILG". The ILGWU grew in geographical scope, membership size,
               and political influence to become one of the most powerful forces in American organized
               labor by mid-century. Representing workers in the women's garment industry, the ILGWU
               worked to improve working and living conditions of its members through collective
               bargaining agreements, training programs, health care facilities, cooperative housing,
               educational opportunities, and other efforts. The ILGWU merged with the Amalgamated
               Clothing and Textile Workers Union in 1995 to form the Union of Needle trades, Industrial
               and Textile Employees (UNITE). UNITE merged with the Hotel Employees and Restaurant
               Employees Union (HERE) in 2004 to create a new union known as UNITE HERE. The two
               unions that formed UNITE in 1995 represented only 250,000 workers between them, down
               from the ILGWU's peak membership of 450,000 in 1969.</div>  </a>

            <div class="para">Formed in 1937, the Research Department of the International Ladies' Garment Workers'
               Union (ILGWU) supported the administrative operations of the Union and coordinated
               the ILGWU's investigative operations. It provided union leaders with information on
               wages, working conditions, economic conditions, and other matters in the women's garment
               industry; analyzed information for the union; and monitored developments in the industry.
               </div>
            <div class="para"> In addition to providing research for union leadership, Research Department staff
               prepared materials for Congressional testimony, presented cases on behalf of local
               unions to the War Labor Board, and worked to administer the Fair Labor Standards Act.
               At times, the director of the Research Department represented the ILGWU in national
               forums. </div>
            <div class="para"> The Department also maintained an extensive library, collecting and housing documents
               from Union administrative staff that were deemed substantive and of lasting value
               to the Union, whether produced internally or externally. The information gathered
               by the Department was of particular value during labor disputes and contract negotiations.
               </div>
            <div class="para"> Lazare Teper was the founding director of the ILGWU's Research Department, working
               in that position from 1937 to 1980. Born in Russia sometime between 1906 and 1908,
               Teper later studied at the University of Paris and earned his doctorate at Johns Hopkins
               University. He died in New York City in 1985.</div>  </a>

            <div class="para">The Research Department records reflect the department's varied functions, documenting
               its role in gathering and analyzing information for international and local union
               leadership, representing the union before government and labor organizations, and
               gathering materials of research, and oftentimes historical, value. Some segments of
               the records focus on one aspect of the department's work, and others include documentation
               across the department's functions. </div>
            <div class="para"> Research Department director Lazare Teper's papers, for example, include files relating
               to the Wage Stabilization Board (5780/105). The department also maintained records
               focused on the National Coat and Suit Industry Board (statements of receipts and disbursements,
               label division reports, meetings minutes, bulletins to members, and other reports
               and resolutions), as well as some related legal files (5780/123). Also among the documents
               collected by the Research Department are the New York Coat and Suit Industry Reports
               between 1934 and 1960. (5780/168) </div>
            <div class="para"> Parts of the Research Department records consist primarily of collected documents
               from ILGWU affiliates. In this way, they resemble and, in some instances, complement
               the parts of the Archives Department Records (5780/121, 5780/121 PUBS), records generated
               by local unions (Series III), and the general collection of ILGWU publications (5780
               PUBS). Research Department records of this kind contain records of predecessor unions
               to the ILGWU and ILGWU local union records (5780/045), or the annual report, "Conditions
               in the Women's Clothing Industry" (5780/078). </div>
            <div class="para"> Other parts of the Research Department records document all of the department's functions.
               These records include financial and administrative reports, meeting minutes, and correspondence
               (5780/056, 5780/209), collected printed material (5780/168), and ILGWU statements
               on issues related to the garment industry (5780/209). </div>
            <div class="para"> The Research Department reports primarily consists of reports from the Research Department,
               including its annual "Conditions in the Women's Clothing Industry."</div>  </a>
