            of the United States Department of Labor in 1936. This pamphlet analyzes the social

            <div class="para">This case resulted in New York State's 1933 minimum wage law for women and children
               being declared unconstitutional. Both New York State's Court of Appeals and the United
               States Supreme Court found that a state may not regulate the wages of adult women,
               because to do so would interfere with their freedom to contract, guaranteed to them
               by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution. </div>
            <div class="para"> The case began when Joseph Tipaldo, manager of the Spotlight Laundry of Brooklyn,
               was indicted by a Kings County Grand Jury on November 2, 1934, and charged with "altering
               books and records for the purpose of concealing the failure to pay female employees
               the minimum fair wage prescribed in a mandatory order of the Industrial Commissioner
               of New York State." Tipaldo claimed the minimum wage law operated to deprive him of
               his liberty and property without due process of law and compelled him to be a witness
               against himself in a criminal case. The law required him to keep a record of the wages
               paid to and hours worked by his women employees. Tipaldo sued for a writ of habeas
               corpus in April, 1935. The writ was denied by Justice May of New York's Supreme Court
               who found the 1933 minimum wage law to be constitutional. Tipaldo appealed to the
               Court of Appeals and this decision was reversed. The United States Supreme Court upheld
               the Court of Appeals decision.</div>  </a>
