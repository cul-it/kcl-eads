            <div class="para">The Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of Manhattan,
               New York City, on March 25, 1911, was the deadliest industrial disaster in the history
               of the city, and one of the deadliest in U.S. history. The fire caused the deaths
               of 146 garment workers -123 women and girls and 23 men  -  who died from the fire,
               smoke inhalation, or falling or jumping to their deaths. Most of the victims were
               recent Italian and Jewish immigrant women and girls aged 14 to 23; of the victims
               whose ages are known, the oldest victim was 43-year-old Providenza Panno, and the
               youngest were 14-year-olds Kate Leone and Rosaria "Sara" Maltese. 
               The factory was located on the 8th, 9th, and 10th floors of the Asch Building, at
               23â€“29 Washington Place, near Washington Square Park. The 1901 building still stands
               today and is now known as the Brown Building. It is part of and owned by New York
               University. </div>
            <div class="para">Because the doors to the stairwells and exits were locked (a then-common practice
               to prevent workers from taking unauthorized breaks and to reduce theft), many of the
               workers who could not escape from the burning building jumped from the high windows.
               The fire led to legislation requiring improved factory safety standards and helped
               spur the growth of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU), which
               fought for better working conditions for sweatshop workers.
               The building has been designated a National Historic Landmark and a New York City
               landmark.</div>  </a>
