            in his role as president of the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen [BRT] and on behalf
            of other local unions against the Long Island Rail Road Company [LIRR], the Association
            of American Railroads [AAR], and other associated corporate entities in order to recover
            damages incurred by the BRT and its union members during a 26 day strike in July and
            August 1960. [Civil Action No. 60-3496]</div>

            <p></p>
            
            <div class="para">After the conclusion of a twenty-six day strike by the workers on the LIRR, the BRT
               and its officers filed suit against the LIRR, the AAR, and other ssociated corporate
               entities, alleging that sometime prior to 1959, the vice-president in charge of the
               law department of the AAR met with designated representatives of the other railroad
               defendants, including the LIRR, to create a pool of their assets and earnings for
               the purpose of assisting any participating member which might be affected by a work
               stoppage or strike. The plaintiffs argued that this artificially strengthened the
               economic bargaining position of individual railroad companies in collective bargaining
               with unions. </div>
            <div class="para"> The BRT and its officers contended that the costs the union incurred during the strike,
               which was prompted by the failure of collective bargaining and mediation proceedings
               between the LIRR and the BRT in 1959-1960 to establish a five day work week without
               a reduction in pay for the LIRR's employees, were a result of the LIRR entering into
               the "strike insurance" pool. This suit was filed to determine the legality of the
               LIRR, AAR, and other associated railroads entering into this pool with the understanding
               that if the "strike insurance" was itself illegal, then the defendants would be liable
               for the damages incurred by the plaintiffs while their members were in strike. The
               plaintiffs further charged that the defendants used some funds from the pool to run
               a campaign through the AAR's public relations department designed to influence public
               opinion against organized labor. </div>
            <div class="para"> The only question under consideration by the court was whether the LIRR's purchase
               of "strike insurance" through the AAR was illegal. In 1962, the court found that it
               was not. </div>
            <div class="para"> Not included in this collection is the decision of the court, which found in favor
               of the defendants and dismissed the suit without cost [211 F. Supp. 478 (S.D.N.Y.
               1962)]. The decision of the court may be found <a target="_top" HREF="http://www.ecases.us/case/nysd/c1888002/kennedy-v-long-island-railroad-company">here</a>.</div>  </a>

            <div class="para">Inclusive date range: 1961-1962 </div>
            <div class="para"> Bulk date: 1961 </div>
            <div class="para"> This collection consists of two copies of a brief filed on behalf of the BRT, et
               al., plaintiffs, by W. P. Kennedy against the LIRR the AAR and associated corporate
               entities, as well as the jointly prepared record of proceedings, which include the
               exhibits to joint stipulation of facts, contained in three bound volumes. The brief
               and the bound volumes of the proceeding contain tables of contents and lists of exhibits
               presented during the proceedings. The plaintiffs were seeking monetary recompense
               for damages suffered during a 26 day strike in the summer of 1960 as well as questioning
               the legality of the LIRR entering, under the auspices of the AAR, into a "strike insurance"
               monetary pool with other rail carriers in order to strengthen their position in collective
               bargaining with their employees' unions. Plaintiffs charged that this action was in
               violation of the Railway Labor Act, the Interstate Commerce Act, and the Sherman Act.
               </div>
            <div class="para"> Included in the plaintiffs' exhibits are reproductions of advertisements the AAR
               ran in daily newspapers, condemning the practice of "featherbedding" (i.e. retaining
               jobs that are identified as obsolete, generally as the result of a union contract).
               These ads compare the cost of featherbedding to the railroads with major American
               disasters, such as the San Francisco earthquake of 1906 and the Chicago fire of 1871,
               in an attempt, the plaintiffs argue, to turn public opinion against the unions. Also
               included in the exhibits are excerpts from the BRT's weekly newsletter and the newspaper,
               Labor.</div>  </a>
