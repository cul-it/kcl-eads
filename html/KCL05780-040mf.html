            <p></p>
            
            <div class="para">The International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union was founded in New York City in 1900
               by mostly Socialist immigrant workers who sought to unite the various crafts in the
               growing women's garment industry. The union soon reflected changes in the sector and
               rapidly organized thousands of unskilled and semi-skilled women, mostly Jewish and
               Italian young immigrants. Exemplifying the "new unionism," the ILGWU led two of the
               most widespread and best-known industrial strikes of the early Twentieth Century:
               the shirtwaist makers' strike of 1909 in New York City and the cloak makers' strike
               of 1910 in Chicago. The union also tried to adapt to the fragmented and unstable nature
               of the industry. It adopted the "protocol of peace," a system of industrial relations
               that attempted to ensure stability and limit strikes and production disruption by
               providing for an arbitration system to resolve disputes.</div>
            <div class="para"> The ILGWU exemplified the European-style social unionism of its founding members.
               They pursued bread and butter issues but provided educational opportunities, benefits,
               and social programs to union members as well. In 1919, the ILGWU became the first
               American union to negotiate an unemployment compensation fund that was contributed
               to by its employers. The ILGWU also pioneered in the establishment of an extremely
               progressive health care program for its members which included not only regional Union
               Health Centers but also a resort for union workers, known as Unity House. The Union
               also had an imaginative and pioneering Education Department which not only trained
               workers in traditional union techniques, but provided courses in citizenship and the
               English language.</div>
            <div class="para"> David Dubinsky, an immigrant from Belarus who came to the US in 1911, provided strong
               leadership that led to unprecedented growth in the union during his presidency from
               1932 to 1966. He led the union through successful internal anti-communist struggles,
               built on the ascendancy of industrial unionism by encouraging the formation of the
               Committee for Industrial Organization, and helped the union become an important political
               force in New York City and state politics, and in the national Democratic Party and
               Liberal Party as well.</div>
            <div class="para"> In the period following the Second World War, the union suffered a decline in membership
               as manufacturers avoided unionization and took advantage of less expensive labor by
               moving shops from the urban centers in the northeast to the south, and later abroad.
               The ethnic and racial character of the ILGWU also changed as European immigrants were
               supplanted by Asians, Latin Americans, African- Americans, and immigrants from the
               Caribbean.</div>
            <div class="para"> In July 1995 the ILGWU merged with the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union
               (ACTWU) at a joint convention, forming UNITE (Union of Needletrades, Industrial and
               Textile Employees). At the time the new union had a membership of about 250,000 in
               the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico.</div>  </a>
