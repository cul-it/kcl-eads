            <p></p>
            
            <div class="para">The National Association of Post Office Craftsmen was founded in 1882 when J. Holt
               Greene, a clerk in the Louisville, Kentucky, post office began corresponding with
               other post offices throughout the country in an effort to promote a national convention
               of postal clerks to be held in Washington. </div>
            <div class="para"> Between 1882 and 1890, several local organizations of postal clerks were established
               and two conventions were called to establish contacts between the independent associations.
               In 1890, the New York organization issued a call to all first-class post offices to
               send delegates to a national convention. Delegates assembled in Washington and formed
               the National Association of Post Office Clerks [NAPOC]. Eight-hour day, fifteen-day
               vacation, and salary classification bills were drawn and submitted to Congress. The
               vacation bill was passed that same year, but the hours and classification bills could
               not get out of committee. </div>
            <div class="para"> At the second convention of the NAPOC in 1891, a legislative committee was created
               to lobby on the organization's behalf. The legislative committee of NAPOC lobbied
               vigorously and persistently during 1892 and 1903, but with little success. Their efforts
               led to the Postmaster General to issue an order forbidding any "Postmaster, Post-office
               Clerk, Letter Carrier, Railway Postal Clerk, or other postal employee" from travelling
               to Washington to lobby Congress. </div>
            <div class="para"> During the convention of 1897, a factional dispute arose in the NAPOC that arose
               in part because of the NAPOC's failure to secure legislation and disagreement on how
               best to circumvent the Postmaster General's order. The granting of membership to supervisory
               employees was also an issue. Locals from Chicago, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and San
               Francisco withdrew from the National Association and together with a large group from
               New York formed the United Association of Post Office Clerks. In 1899 the two groups
               merged back into one organization, now called the United National Association of Post
               Office Clerks [UNAPOC]. </div>
            <div class="para"> In 1900, a group of Chicago postal workers organized and affiliated themselves with
               the AFL; because of this affiliation, the Chicago local was denied entrance to UNAPOC.
               UNAPOC refused to affiliate with the larger labor movement both because of their status
               as federal employees and because they preferred to work "in such a way as to conciliate
               and never embarrass the [Postal] Department." However, this became problematic when
               President Theodore Roosevelt issued an executive order forbidding federal employees
               to lobby for pay raises or benefits except through their departmental supervisors.
               This became known as the "gag order" and essentially stopped UNAPOC's lobbying efforts
               entirely. The "gag order" was strengthened by Roosevelt in 1906 and was later reinforced
               by President Taft. </div>
            <div class="para"> The 1905 convention was marked by factional strife and the delegates of thirty-five
               locals withdrew from the convention. It was felt that since UNAPOC was silenced in
               Congress, the clerks should find another way to represent their interests. In August
               1906, locals in San Francisco, Milwaukee, and Louisville, joined the independent Chicago
               group and formed the National Federation of Post Office Clerks [NFPOC]. They were
               granted a charter by the AFL. The "gag order" was repealed in 1912 under the Lloyd-LaFollette
               Act, leaving UNAPOC and NFPOC in competition and hostile towards each other. </div>
            <div class="para"> In 1917, the Brotherhood of Railway Postal Clerks merged with the National Federation
               in the AFL and from this time on, the Federation claimed to be the leading clerks
               organization with UNAPOC dwindling slowly over the years. The National Association
               of Letter Carriers and the Railway Mail Association also affiliated with the AFL in
               1917. </div>
            <div class="para"> During the 1920s, the AFL postal groups actively opposed the Postal Department while
               advocating for their members; UNAPOC assumed a conciliatory attitude. The Harding
               Administration had placed itself on record as opposing AFL affiliation for government
               employees and UNAPOC adopted policies calculated to win Departmental favor. For many
               years UNAPOC considered itself a "professional organization" and not a "trade union."
               </div>
            <div class="para"> In 1931, UNAPOC and the NFPOC again met in merger discussions initiated by UNAPOC.
               The Association had for many years advocated one big union of all postal employee
               as a matter of principle, but these discussions fell apart because of the Association's
               insistence that a merged organization would have to abandon the AFL. However, the
               1930s and 1940s were marked by a decline in membership even as UNAPOC continued to
               lobby on behalf of its members and to provide them with benefits. It also lost lost
               its enmity toward the labor movement and took its place as a genuine independent union.
               </div>
            <div class="para"> In 1948, UNAPOC again called for a single union for all postal employees and opened
               its membership to other postal employees. In 1956, the name of the organization was
               changed to the United National Association of Post Office Craftsmen to more accurately
               describe its scope and ambition. </div>
            <div class="para"> In 1961, UNAPOC and the NFPOC merged to close the split of over fifty years in the
               ranks of the post office clerks. They were joined by the United Postal Workers and
               the National Postal Transport Association and together they formed the United Federation
               of Post Office Clerks, AFL-CIO.</div>  </a>
