            <div class="para">The United Mine Workers of America (UMW or UMWA) is a North American labor union best
               known for representing coal miners. Today, the Union also represents health care workers,
               truck drivers, manufacturing workers and public employees in the United States and
               Canada. Although its main focus has always been on workers and their rights, the UMW
               of today also advocates for better roads, schools, and universal health care. By 2014,
               coal mining had largely shifted to open pit mines in Wyoming, and there were only
               60,000 active coal miners. The UMW was left with 35,000 members, of whom 20,000 were
               coal miners, chiefly in underground mines in Kentucky and West Virginia. However it
               was responsible for pensions and medical benefits for 40,000 retired miners, and for
               50,000 spouses and dependents </div>
            <div class="para"> The UMW was founded in Columbus, Ohio, on January 25, 1890, with the merger of two
               old labor groups, the Knights of Labor Trade Assembly No. 135 and the National Progressive
               Miners Union. Adopting the model of the American Federation of Labor (AFL), the union
               was initially established as a three-pronged labor tool: to develop mine safety; to
               improve mine workers' independence from the mine owners and the company store; and
               to provide miners with collective bargaining power. After passage of the National
               Recovery Act in 1933, organizers spread throughout the United States to organize all
               coal miners into labor unions. Under the powerful leadership of John L. Lewis, the
               UMW broke with the American Federation of Labor and set up its own federation, the
               CIO. Its organizers fanned out to organize major industries, including automobiles,
               steel, electrical equipment, rubber, paint and chemical, and fought a series of battles
               with the AFL. The UMW grew to 800,000 members and was an element in the New Deal Coalition
               supporting Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Lewis broke with Roosevelt
               in 1940 and left the CIO, leaving the UMW increasingly isolated in the labor movement.
               During World War II the UMW was involved in a series of major strikes and threatened
               walkouts that angered public opinion and energized pro-business opponents. After the
               war the UMW concentrated on gaining large increases in wages, medical services and
               retirement benefits for its shrinking membership.</div>  </a>
