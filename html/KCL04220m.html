            <div class="para">March 12, 1908 - September 5, 2003 </div>
            <div class="para"> Milton Konvitz, a Cornell University faculty member and authority on constitutional
               and labor law, and civil and human rights, died Sept. 5 at the age of 95. Konvitz
               was a founding faculty member in the School of Industrial and Labor Relations from
               1946 until his retirement in 1973. He was also a professor in Cornell's Law School.
               </div>
            <div class="para"> Konvitz is perhaps best known for his American Ideals course, which he taught to
               more than 8,000 students over the course of his career, never giving the same lecture
               twice. "I saw the U.S. Constitution as it has been interpreted as a magnificent depository
               of our ideals, both individual and social," he said. His course exposed students to
               the great intellectual thinkers and philosophers throughout history whose writings
               had shaped those ideals. They included Sophocles, whose play Antigone is Cornell's
               New Student Reading Project this year. One student he influenced was U.S. Supreme
               Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Cornell Class of 1954, who considers him a mentor.
               </div>
            <div class="para"> At Cornell Konvitz also was a founder of the university's Department of Near Eastern
               Studies and Program of Jewish Studies. "I felt it was essential for a college interested
               in the humanities not to leave out Hebrew language and literature," he said. "And
               the knowledge of Jewish history, which began 4,000 years ago and has contributed to
               civilization no less than Greek, Roman or English history, is important to today's
               students -Jewish and non-Jewish." He often hosted students at his Ithaca home and
               helped start the first Kosher dining option at Cornell, Young Israel House. </div>
            <div class="para"> In addition, for nearly 30 years he directed the Liberian Codification Project, which
               drew up the official body of statutory laws that is still in force in the Republic
               of Liberia today, despite the current political upheaval there. Konvitz also edited
               the opinions of Liberia's Supreme Court and received the Grand Band of the Order of
               the Star of Africa, the highest award given to foreigners, as well as an honorary
               degree from the University of Liberia, one of seven honorary degrees he received in
               his lifetime. </div>
            <div class="para"> Active as a scholar and writer until his death, he wrote books and articles on American
               constitutional law that won him wide recognition and were cited in U.S. Supreme Court
               opinions. Among his nine books is Fundamental Liberties of a Free People: Religion,
               Speech, Press, Assembly, which was republished earlier this year with an expanded
               introduction by him that is strongly critical of the Rehnquist Supreme Court. Other
               books include A Century of Civil Rights (1983) and Judaism and Human Rights (2nd ed.
               2001). He also edited a dozen volumes, including two on American philosopher Ralph
               Waldo Emerson, whose thinking shaped his views. One Emersonian idea he absorbed was
               that readers give life to books, which Konvitz recast as follows: "It is in their
               hearing that students bring life to the words, the thoughts, the teacher." </div>
            <div class="para"> Konvitz was born in Safed, Palestine (now Israel ), in 1908, the son of a rabbi.
               He immigrated to the United States in 1915 and became a naturalized citizen in 1926.
               He received a bachelor's degree in 1929 and a law degree in 1930, both from New York
               University, and a Ph.D. in philosophy from Cornell in 1933. Before joining Cornell's
               faculty, he was one of three assistant general counsels to Thurgood Marshall at the
               NAACP Legal Defense Fund for three years. </div>
            <div class="para"> He is survived by his wife, Mary, of Oakhurst, N.J.; a brother, Phillip, of Elberon,
               N.J.; a son and daughter-in-law, Josef and Isa, of Paris, France; and two grandsons,
               Eli and Ezra. Josef Konvitz, who grew up in Ithaca, is now an official at the Organization
               for Economic Co-operation and Development.</div>  </a>
