            <div class="para">Labor activist, union organizer, social theorist and Trotskyite. </div>
            <div class="para"> George Saul was active in the union movement during the 1920s, 1930s, and early 1940s.
               During this period, Saul was involved in a number of significant struggles between
               labor and capital, including the I.W.W.-led strike of miners against the Rockefeller
               owned Colorado Fuel and Iron Company in 1927 and the communist-led strike of textile
               workers in Gastonia, N.C. in 1929. He was also involved in organizing Ford employees
               in Detroit in the 1930s and early 1940s. While a member of the United Automobile Workers
               (CIO), Saul was constantly at odds with the union leadership and, as a result, left
               the union movement shortly after the end of World War II. Saul was also active in
               the Communist Party during the 1920s, turning to Trotskyism in the 1930s because of
               disagreements with the party leadership over tactics and general principles.</div>  </a>

            <div class="para">Consists of a single draft of an uncompleted autobiography. The bulk of the autobiography
               concerns Saul's life prior to his becoming involved with the union movement. The aspects
               of Saul's life discussed include his childhood in Colorado, his experiences in the
               army during World War I, and his years as a college student in Dvner during the 1920s.
               The latter part of the manuscript cursorily covers Saul's union activities, including
               his participation in the Colorado Fuel and Iron and Gastonia strikes. Also included
               in the latter part is a brief discussion of the formation of the UAW in Detroit. The
               manuscript also briefly covers the impact of the Sacco and Vanzetti case on the development
               of Saul's radicalism; the need to organize black workers, particularly in the South;
               the author's reasons for leaving the union movment; and his reasons for defecting
               to Trotskyism.</div>  </a>
