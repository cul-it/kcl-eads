                     <div class="para">Image depicts two male employees at a turbo steamer, used for the ageing of fabrics,
                        probably in the Cranston, R.I., plant of the Cranston Print Works. To make the design
                        on the cloth color-fast, the cloth is aged by neutral or acid steaming or "cured"
                        by dry heat to develop and fix the colors. The Sprague family originally owned the
                        Sprague Print Works, which passed to B.B. &amp; R. Knight after the Civil War, and was
                        reorganized as the Cranston Print Works in 1920. The original of this photo was probably
                        taken in conjunction with the 150th anniversary of the Cranston Print Works. A detail
                        of this photo is found in "Cranston: a designing company". 25.75 x 20.5 cm.</div>
