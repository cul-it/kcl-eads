         <div class="item">For some five decades, 1947-1995, Prof. Robert J. Alexander (1918-) has been an engage
            witness and active documentarian of almost all of the major political and social events
            in Latin America. During his visits to various Latin American countries, prof. Alexander
            held numerous interviews with people from all segments in society. Alexander kept
            notes on most (some 12,000) interviews and later typed them out.</div>

            <p></p>
            
            <div class="para">Born in 1918 in Canton Ohio and raised in New Jersey, Robert J. Alexander was the
               son of a university professor. His life trajectory was rooted in the tumultuous years
               of the Great Depression, the "Red Decade" as it came to be called, when he served
               as a leader of the Young People's Socialist League (YPSL) at his high school. Like
               many of his generation, Alexander's strongly-held social democratic political beliefs
               were shaped by his loss of faith in free enterprise as a self-sustaining economic
               system, his rejection of laissez-faire as a prescription for sound government, and
               his belief in the positive contribution of organized labor to the cause of social
               reform. Profoundly influenced by the New Deal and inspired by its leader FDR, Alexander
               came to strongly believe in both the desirability of an activist state and in the
               efficacy of government in resolving social and economic problems. </div>
            <div class="para"> The origin of Alexander's life-long involvement with Latin America, which distinguished
               him from others of his generation, can be found in the charismatic undergraduate teaching
               of Austrian-born Frank Tannenbaum (1893-1969) at Columbia University. Tannenbaum,
               after an early 1914 arrest in New York for anarchist activism, had gone on to get
               an economics degree at the newly-formed Brookings Institution in 1927 with a thesis
               on agrarian reform after the Mexican Revolution of 1910-1917. Over the next two decades,
               Tannenbaum would be widely recognized as an important if heterodox Latin Americanist,
               a trans-disciplinary figure wo laid the foundations for the scholarly study of the
               Mexican Revolution as well as for the field of comparative race relations in the Americas.
               </div>
            <div class="para"> Under Tannenbaum's influence, Alexander completed a masters thesis in 1941 on labor
               in Latin America and then discovered, as he says wryly, that he was now "'an expert'
               on Latin American labor for the simple reason that no one knew anything" about the
               subject. He spent 1943 to 1945 in England with the US Army Air Force, and it was there
               that he first demonstrated the remarkable initiative and self-discipline that made
               him a master documentarian. Fascinated by the British unions and the Labor Party,
               Alexander not only sought out and interviewed leaders and activists but typed up contemporaneous
               notes on the conversations. </div>
            <div class="para"> His war-time experience also shaped his larger political outlook. Having left the
               Socialist because of its pacifist position, Alexander became convinced that the transcendent
               issues involved in international politics (democracy versus totalitarianism) were
               inseparable from the domestic political conflicts within countries. Moreover, World
               War II furrther strengthened his belief in the essential decency of the policies of
               the US government, whatever its mistakes. It is not surprising that this strong identification
               with the "American mission" in the world and his anti-communist social democratic
               politics would lead Alexander to decisively align himself, as did so many liberals,
               with the US side of the emerging Cold War after 1946. </div>
            <div class="para"> After a brief sting at the Labor Relations Division of the Office of the Coordinator
               of Inter-American Affairs run by Nelson Rockefeller, Alexander returned to Columbia
               to work with Tannenbaum on a doctoral thesis in economics on "Organized Labor in Chile."
               With a grant from the State Department, he conducted fieldwork in 1946-1947 during
               which time he carried out a national industrial relations survey which served as the
               basis of his still useful but unpublished 1950 thesis. During these six months, he
               also took extensive notes on the three hundred and forty nine interviews he conducted
               during this period of intense political and trade union ferment under a Communist-backed
               government led by President Gonzalez Videla, who would turn on his leftist allies
               in 1947. </div>
            <div class="para"> During this initial trip to South America, Alexander also stopped in Brazil and Argentina,
               nations that were each experiencing a remarkable period of mass political mobilization.
               In Argentina, in particular, the rise of the charismatic Army Colonel Juan Peron to
               the presidency in the 1946 election opened an entirely new historical epoch in Latin
               America that scholars have come to call the Populist Era. A sui-generis figure, the
               regime of Juan Peron and his eventual wife Evita was vigorously and publicly opposed
               as fascist by the US government, as well as by social-democratic and communist groups
               in Argentina and abroad. Given thses concerns, Alexander would make the Peron phenomenon
               the subject of his first book The Peron Era, published in 1951, that was translated,
               oft reprinted, and would remain the only treatment in English for the next decade.
               </div>
            <div class="para"> Although hostile to Peron, Alexander's book displayed the virtues that grew out of
               his emerging research methodology based on extensive interviewing with people of all
               political perspectives and from all walks of life. Reviewers have often commented
               on Alexander's unique ability to connect with individuals, establish a degree of trust,
               and then ask the questions that would generate the richest replies. As political scientist
               Lars Schoultz wrote in 1975, Alexander's "enviable collection of personal interviews
               with party leaders," and "the wealth of data" they contain, is especially impressive
               for "anyone who has attempted the frustrating task of elite interviewing." </div>
            <div class="para"> Joining the faculty at Rutgers University in 1947, Alexander traveled to and within
               the countries of Latin America hundreds of times over the next thirty-five years (and
               continued to do so, but more sporadically, until the early 1990s). Even today, he
               is the only Latin Americanist who has not only traveled in all latin American countries
               but had visited almost all the countries and colonial dependencies in the Caribbean.
               Yet this breadth of exposure was not achieved at the expense of sustained and concentrated
               research. Throughout his career, he specialized in six major Latin American countries
               (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Bolivia, Venezuela, and Peru) which together make up more
               than half of the region's total population and account for thirteen of his twenty-five
               published monographs. </div>
            <div class="para"> Alexander's sustained engagement with Latin America began at a unique moment in the
               history of the region and of the United States. The US emergence as a truly global
               economic, military, and political superpower in the mid- twentieth century had a mixed
               impact on the study of Latin America in the United States. As Mark Berger has shown,
               the "Good Neighbor" policy of the 1930s and the strategic demands of World War II
               enhanced government and academic interest in Latin America but this "growth and disicplinary
               diversification" quickly dissipated after the end of the war. This relative decline
               in academic interest in the region would continue until the wake-up call represented
               by the Cuban Revolution of 1959. The 1960s were marked by a vast increase in funding
               and a greatly heightened interest in the region, whether for political, cultural,
               or literary reasons, leading to a greater instutionalization of Latin American studies
               in the US. </div>
            <div class="para"> The postwar US neglect of the region occurred at a moment when Latin America was
               experiencing social, economic, and political transformations. During these decades,
               the region's largest countries embarked on an unprecedented process of industrialization,
               with a rapid expansion of the urban working and middle classes. This was accompanied
               by the emergence of the popular sectors, particularly organized labor, in national
               political life and the flourishing of new political and ideological currents. With
               acute insight and surprising tact, Robert Alexander established a place for himself
               as a witness to key episodes such as the rise and fall of Peron, the Bolivian Revolution
               of 1952, the overthrowing of the Perez Jimenez dictatorship in Venezuela in 1958,
               the rise of power of Fidel Castro in Cuba, and the turbulent years of the Christian
               Democratic government of Eduardo Frei (1964-1970) and the left- wing Popular Unity
               government of Salvador Allende in Chile. </div>
            <div class="para"> Alexander's extensive travels within Latin America were undertaken under a number
               of auspices and for different purposes. His 1962 book on organized labor grew out
               a 1956 grant from the Ford Foundation's Inter-University Study of Labor Problems in
               Economic Development. And his yearly trips to Bolivia in the 1950s, the subject of
               his third book The Bolivian National Revolution (1958), were funded in part by consultant-ships
               with the US aid program to that country. Given his extensive knowledge and contacts,
               Alexander was also an active participant in the US government policy debate about
               Latin America during the Kennedy administration. Although he did publish a book on
               the region with a US Congressman, Berger likely exaggerates when he calls Alexander
               "a major figure behind the Alliance for Progress." </div>
            <div class="para"> Yet many of Alexander's most important early trips were not strictly academic at
               all. As he freely revealed to his readers, Alexander in the 1950s was a combative
               opponent of both communism and Peronism and their fellow travelers. Throughout his
               career, his scholarly activities were informed by a clear political agenda: to build
               support for mass-based reformist parties that would fight the communists "on their
               own grounds and among the groups from whom they especially drew support." Yet not
               all such non-communist reformist political movements and leaders would win Alexander's
               favor, precisely because many tended to be highly nationalistsic and resentful of
               US predominance and influence. The groups favored by Alexander, as well as US policymakers,
               were those that combined social reform commitments with a reliable policy of collaboration
               with the US in the struggle against the Soviet bloc and Communist threat within their
               own countries. </div>
            <div class="para"> As a pro-labor US anti-communist, Professor Alexander cultivated friendships with
               many of the key Latin American political personalities of the "Democratic Left," such
               as Haya de la Torre, Jose Figueres, Romulo Betancourt, and Victor Paz Estenssoro.
               Thus he was particularly well-placed to gain special access, at the highest level,
               to the leadership of the major center-left political parties of Venezuela, Peru, and
               Bolivia (AD, APRA, and MNR). Originating in the student, labor, and popular insurgencies
               of the 1930s, these anti-status quo parties had briefly risen to power after World
               War II but were subsuquently ousted and persecuted by rightist military regimes. When
               these populist parties did return to national prominence, their chastened leaders
               served as dependable allies of the US in its struggle in the 1960s against the Cuban
               Revolution. </div>
            <div class="para"> Thus Alexander was, in any sense, an intellectual engage as well as a direct participant
               in the bitter political struggles that marked inter-hemispheric political and labor
               affairs. Going back to 1948, he had worked closely with the American Federation of
               Labor's regional representative Serafino Romauldi, an anti-communist Italian immigrant.
               He also collaborated closely, for many years, with the notorious eminence girs of
               the Cold War, the one-time communist Jay Lovestone who headed the International Department
               of the AFL and later AFL-CIO. Indeed, at least eight of his trips to Latin America
               between 1952-1959 were made with funds received through Lovestone, from both government
               and CIA sources. Whether despite or precisely because of his political militancy,
               Alexander actively crossed ideological divides to interview even those active in organizations
               and movements he bitterly opposed such as Communists. Indeed, his reports to Lovestone
               about his travels contained detailed and frank assessments of the strategic and tactical
               issues facing their political "camp" in the different Latin American countries. </div>
            <div class="para"> As a leading Cold War operative, Alexander gained the opprobrium of critics of the
               United States. To one Soviet scholar, this "reactionary American historian [sic]"
               was "an apologist for the aggressive policies of US monopolists." Another Soviet analyst
               particularly objected to his pioneering monographs on labor and communism: "Alexander
               is noted for his works which distort the history of the labor movement in Latin America.
               Sponsored by AFL money, he carried on 'research' in various Latin American countries,
               establishing contacts with renegade and opportunistsic elements ousted from communist
               parties. Notes on talks with these renegades serve as the main source of Alexander's
               'works.'" </div>
            <div class="para"> Alexander's political alignments were equally suspect in some conservative US and
               Latin American circles in the 1950s, especially given the dubious and often "communist"
               origin of many of his favored political parties and their record of revolutionary-sounding
               rhetoric. In 1963, for example, the ultra-conservative US scholar J. Fred Rippy attacked
               Alexander, known for his "slanted views of US policy," as a man "well known by members
               of his profession as a champion of radical causes and of public contributions to them."
               After the 1958 ouster of Venezuela's Perez Jimenez, the military dictator's US supporters
               issued a red-baiting report that condemned the new AD President Romulo Betancourt
               as a crypto communist. In classic McCarthyite fashion, they profiled the subsersive
               background of his US supporters, including Alexander and other members of the Inter-American
               Foundation for Democracy and Freedom; this "extreme leftwing group," they reported,
               was full of "communists, pro-Communists, fellow travelers, Socialists, and left wing
               liberals." </div>
            <div class="para"> When Latin American studies did finally boom in the 1960s, however, the new generation
               of scholars had little patience for the "Cold War liberalism" that had led Alexander
               to support the 1954 coup against the democratically-elected government of Jacobo Arbenz
               in Guatemala or to oppose Fidel Castro as early as 1959 (after which point he was
               barred from travel to the island). Faced with the leftward shift in the political
               climate in both Latin America and the United States in the 1960s, Alexander remained
               firm in his anti-communist and pro-US foreign policy alignment in the region. He was
               not swayed even by the bloody 1973 military coup that overthrew the democratically-elected
               Popular Unity (UP) coalition headed by President Salvador Allende. In his 1978 book
               The Tragedy of Chile, he emphasized that the UP had used "democratic means to achieve
               a totalitarian society." He also discounted the evidence of CIA complicity in the
               destabilization of the Allende government that was documented by Senate Select Committee
               on Intelligence in the famous "Church Committee report" of 1977: </div>
            <div class="para"> Whatever the ITT did or did not do, whatever the CIA did or did not do, whatever
               certain US military personnel did or did not do, whatever economic policies the United
               States followed or did not follow with regard to Chile--all of these factors had only
               the most marginal impact in generating the economic and political crisis of the Allende
               regime in its final months. And they had nothing to do with the Chilean military leaders'
               decision to oust the Unidad Popular Regime </div>
            <div class="para"> Not surprisingly, such tough-minded views won Alexander few friends among the new
               generation of academics working on Latin America. His work was increasingly criticized
               for its openly partisan political commitments and absence of scholarly rigor, which
               had increasingly become the norm with the professionalization of Latin Americanist
               research and scholarship. In 1979, a young Chileanist historian Peter Winn described
               Alexander's 1965 monograph on labor as "the most accessible" version of "a liberal
               anti-communist interpretation," but he went on to criticize its "frequently tendentious
               interpretations [based] upon a slender body of research." Another group of labor studies
               scholars in 1964 had criticized his embrace of the simple-minded "anti-Communist line
               of both the United States government and the AFL-CIO" that presented simplistic stories
               of "good guys (i.e. 'democrats') and bad guys (i.e. 'totalitarians')." In their eyes,
               Alexander's "cold war anti- Communist perspective" prevented him "from objectively
               considering the strong appeal of Marxist ideologies in Latin America." Yet even these
               young critics nonetheless recognized that his book on communism was "rich in information
               drawn from interviews and newspapers." </div>
            <div class="para"> The 1980s would witness a greater appreciation for the acuity of some of Alexander's
               assessments of the socio-political affairs of the countries he visited. Alexander,
               "writing from a liberal, anti-communist perspective," was praised by Charles Bergquist
               in 1986 for being the only one of his generation of scholars, whether US or Latin
               American, who "consistently stressed the importance of organized labor in the modern
               historical development of the region." </div>
            <div class="para"> "Until the mid-1960s," another historian observed, "Latin American labor history
               remained a curiously neglected field, with the exception of a few relatively isolated
               figures, such as Robert Alexander." Indeed, "without his immense work there simply
               would not exist any account of the development of the various Latin American labor
               movements." </div>
            <div class="para"> Even the scale of his scholarly production and the extent of his political activism
               was not made clear until the publication, in 1991, of an eighty-four page bibliography
               of his work. Not counting translations or reprintings, Alexander wrote at least twenty-five
               major books, edited two collections of Latin American documents by Romulo Betancourt
               and Haya de la Torre, and served as the major editor for two reference works on political
               parties and politicians in Latin America. In addition, he published almost fifty book
               chapters, eight pamphlets, four hundred newspaper and magazine articles (largely of
               a non-scholarly sort), two hundred book reviews, and seventy-five encyclopedia and
               yearbook entries.</div>  </a>
