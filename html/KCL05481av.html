            <div class="para">The Railroad Industrial Relations Project [RIRP] was established on July 1, 1969 in
               an agreement between the United Transportation Union [UTU] and the School of Industrial
               and Labor Relations [ILR], Cornell University. The purpose of the project was to document
               the formation of the UTU and the history of its predecessor brotherhoods. In addition
               to collecting the records of the UTU and its predecessor organizations, the RIRP conducted
               numerous oral histories with local and national officers of the UTU and its predecessor
               organizations. These interviews were collected between 1970 and 1971 in an effort
               to document the unification effort, the effect it had on members of the predecessor
               brotherhoods, and the everyday lives of railroad employees (these interviews may be
               located in Collection 6058). </div>
            <div class="para"> To supplement this collection of oral histories, the RIRP decided to conduct additional
               oral histories with representatives of the railroad carriers in 1973. The RIRP reached
               out to the National Railway Labor Conference [NRLC] to arrange for this. The NRLC
               is the industrywide bargaining agent for the railroads. It was formed in 1962 with
               the merger of the regional Carriers' Conference Committees (Western, Eastern, and
               Southeastern) so that there would be one entity with which to negotiate. The RIRP
               interviewed three executives of the NRLC (Hiltz, Dempsey, Parks) to document management's
               perspective on the industry and labor relations. </div>
            <div class="para"> The RIRP also reached out to a former president of the industry trade group, the
               Association of American Railroads (loomis), and the vice president of personnel for
               the Illinois Central Gulf Railroad (Oliver) to further broaden the documentation of
               management's perspective. </div>
            <div class="para"> Three additional interviews with two UTU officers were also conducted in 1973, and
               they are included in this collection. The interview with H.E. Gilbert and his wife,
               Alice, and the interview of James Paddock by Miriam Freilicher provide biographical
               information about these two labor leaders. The second interview with Mr. Paddock focuses
               on alcoholism, substance abuse, and the ways in which these diseases may be fought
               within the railroad industry.</div>  </a>
