            <p></p>
            
            <div class="para">The Elmira Central Trades and Labor Assembly was organized in 1894 by 13 unions and
               was chartered by the American Federation of Labor in 1901. The member unions were:
               Plumbers; steam and gas fitters; bricklayers and masons; sheetmetal workers, metal
               polishers and buffers; cigar makers; machinists, carpenters, printers, molders, breweryworkers,
               barbers, tailors and bartenders. </div>
            <div class="para"> Early records of the Chemung County Historical Society show the first elected officers
               of Local 23, Bricklayers, Plasterers and Masons, in 1885 were: Daniel J. Lucy, president;
               John Crowley, vice president; Norman Friend, recording secretary; Michael Murray,
               financial secretary; Dennis Connelly, corresponding secretary, and John Connelly,
               treasurer. </div>
            <div class="para"> John E. Murphy was an early president of the Assembly, for many years located at
               202 East Water St. in what was known as Labor Hall. It moved to 322 Carroll St. in
               1912. After the 1972 flood the Assembly occupied 559 East Church St. </div>
            <div class="para"> In 1957 the Chemung County AFL-CIO Assembly was formed by the AFL unions plus the
               United Auto Workers and the International Union of Electrical Workers of the CIO and
               District 58, International Association of Machinists. </div>
            <div class="para"> One of the old-time unions disappeared when the hand-made cigar business folded.
               The 1901 charter of the Cigarmakers was turned in to Walter L. Wainwright, Assembly
               president, for safe keeping. </div>
            <div class="para"> The building trades led the fight for a five-day work week and an eight-hour day.
               Earlier it had been six days with nine to 10 hours a day. From before World War I
               to 1930, it was eight hours Monday through Friday with four hours on Saturday. In
               the 1930s the Saturday hours were eliminated. </div>
            <div class="para"> The unions led the negotiations for higher wage scales. In 1903 the Painters Union
               asked for $2.50 for an eight-hour day with 45 cents an hour for overtime while the
               Carpenters local asked $3 a day. The Plumbers Union achieved a $3 a day for eight
               hours in 1904. </div>
            <div class="para"> The Assembly often had trouble holding its tradesmen in line. A ruling in 1903 allowing
               members to work on a job with non-union help led to Sheetmetal Workers withdrawing
               from the Assembly. Bricklayers and Masons, who were on strike, also withdrew. They
               were seeking a 45 cent hourly wage and an eight-hour day. </div>
            <div class="para"> H. Paul Shay was Labor Assembly president from 1939-1944. He was business agent of
               Local 289, Theatrical Employees Union, in the 1930s. Shay was a prominent Democrat
               and a candidate for mayor in 1942. He long was chairman of Draft Board 64 during and
               after World War II. </div>
            <div class="para"> Fritz J. Clark of the Communication Workers of America is current president. His
               predecessor was Clarence G. Doty, who served as president in 1961-69, succeeding Wainwright.
               </div>
            <div class="para"> Union labor made its greatest advances after World War II especially higher wages,
               fringe benefits and in some cases improved health standards on the job. Unions often
               went on strike to achieve these goals. </div>
            <div class="para"> The craft unions formed the Elmira Building Trades Council to police their membership
               and protect employers from unfair tactics. A business agent, elected by the membership,
               served as a liason between employers and the workers. </div>
            <div class="para"> The craft unions also had their own business agents. Well-known during this period
               were George Gerard, Charles Spencer and Fred Kohlberger, Earl F. Harris of the Sheetmetal
               Workers and Ralph Halloran of the Electrical Workers achieved responsible positions
               with national headquarters in Washington.</div>  </a>
