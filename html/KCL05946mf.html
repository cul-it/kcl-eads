            <div class="para">The Women's Bureau was created in the Department of Labor by Public Law No. 259 of
               June 5, 1920. The law gave the Bureau the authority to investigate and report to the
               U.S. Dept. of Labor upon all matters pertaining to the welfare of women in industry.
               </div>
            <div class="para"> Throughout its history the Bureau has been concerned not only with women's ability
               to obtain profitable employment, but also their contribution to family income and
               how they could be assisted to balance work and family, a concern that continues to
               this day. The Department of Labor set an example in the 1960s by establishing a demonstration
               child care center in a nearby building for children of their low-income employees.
               In 1982, the Bureau was proud to announce the launch of a major initiative to encourage
               employer-sponsored child care. In 1993 they pressured the passage of the Family and
               Medical Leave Act of 1993. </div>
