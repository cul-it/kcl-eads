            <div class="para">At the request of the Commissioner of Labor the New York State Board of Mediation
               and Arbitration convened in Gloversville on October 5, 1914 to attempt to settle the
               glove cutters strike which had idled 1500 men in 150 plants. Members of the Board
               included Mr. William C, Rogers, chief mediator; Mr. James C. McManus; and Mr. P.S.
               Downey. </div>
            <div class="para"> On August 21, 1914 the glove cutters held a mass meeting in which they voted to ask
               the Glove Manufacturers Association for an increase of 25 cents per dozen on men's
               and boys' gloves and 20 cents per dozen on ladies' gloves. The glove cutters were
               earning an average of $13.30 per week and had not had an increase in wages for 17
               years. The glove cutters struck when the manufacturers turned down the request for
               an increase. Since glove making was the only industry in Fulton County the Board was
               instructed to investigate the situation. During the course of the strike several employers
               settled with their employees for 15 cents a dozen, and the Board recommended that
               the strikers return to work and continue negotiations for an increase of not less
               than 15 cents. The Board's proposals were turned down by the men.</div>  </a>
