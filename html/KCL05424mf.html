            <div class="para">Frank Gilbreth was born in Fairfield, Maine in 1868, to John Hiram and Martha (nee
               Bunker) Gilbreth, and had no formal education beyond high school. </div>
            <div class="para"> At age 3, his father passed away, it was after this that his family moved to Boston,
               Massachusetts. He became a bricklayer apprentice after high school, which led to him
               becoming a building contractor, an inventor with several patents and lastly a management
               engineer. He also became an occasional lecturer at Purdue University, where his papers
               are housed. Gilbreth married Lillian Evelyn Moller on October 19, 1904 in Oakland,
               California; they had 12 children, 11 of whom survived him. </div>
            <div class="para"> As a result of Gilbreth trying to make his bricklaying job faster and easier, he
               and his wife, Lillian Moller Gilbreth, came up with an idea to study the work habits
               of manufacturing and clerical employees in all sorts of industries. They worked to
               find ways to increase output and make the jobs easier. They founded a management consulting
               firm, Gilbreth, Inc. </div>
            <div class="para"> Gilbreth served in the U.S. Army during World War I. He was charged with finding
               quicker and more efficient means of assembling and disassembling small arms. According
               to Claude George (1968), Gilbreth reduced all motions of the hand into some combination
               of 17 basic motions. These included grasp, transport loaded, and hold. Gilbreth named
               the motions therbligs, "Gilbreth" spelled backwards with the th transposed. He used
               a motion picture camera that was calibrated in fractions of minutes to time the smallest
               of motions in workers. </div>
            <div class="para"> According to George the Gilbreths were, most of all, scientists who sought to teach
               management that all parts of the workplace should be constantly questioned, and continuely
               updated. Their emphasis on the 'one best way' and the therbligs predates the development
               of continuous quality improvement (CQI), and the understanding that repeated motions
               can lead to workers experiencing repetitive motion injuries. </div>
            <div class="para"> Gilbreth was a first with many of his ideas, such as positioning a 'caddy' for surgeons
               instruments, so they could be handed them more efficiently and easily. He also devised
               a standard technique for armies to train their recruits how to rapidly disassemble
               and reassemble their weapons even when blindfolded or in total darkness. </div>
            <div class="para"> Gilbreth died of a heart attack on June 14, 1924, at age 55, his wife Lillian outlived
               him by 48 years.</div>  </a>
