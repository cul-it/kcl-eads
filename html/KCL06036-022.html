            <div class="para">Founded in 1900 by local union delegates representing about 2,000 members in cities
               in the northeastern United States, the ILGWU grew in geographical scope, membership
               size, political influence to become one of the most powerful forces in American organized
               labor by mid-century. Representing workers in the women's garment industry, the ILGWU
               worked to improve working and living conditions of its members through collective
               bargaining agreements, training programs, health care facilities, cooperative housing,
               educational opportunities, and other efforts. In 1995, the ILGWU merged with the Amalgamated
               Clothing and Textile Workers Union (ACTWU) to form the Union of Needletrades, Industrial
               and Textile Employees (UNITE).</div>  </a>

            <div class="para">Henoch Mendelsund was born on March 26 (or 23), 1911. Active in the Jewish labor movement
               in his native Poland, he worked as a mechanic and attended Warsaw University. Mendelsund
               arrived in the U.S. in 1941 as one of 1,500 labor leaders and intellectuals rescued
               from the Nazis through the efforts of the ILGWU and other groups under special visas
               authorized by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. He joined the ILGWU as a machine operator,
               and while working in the shop during the day, he attended the New School for Social
               Research at night, earning a master's degree in economics and sociology. </div>
            <div class="para"> In addition to his work in cloak shops, during the war, Mendelsund was a member of
               the National Coat and Suit Recovery Board staff. Mendelsund held many positions during
               his tenure with the ILGWU. In 1949, he became the secretary of Cloak Finishers' Local
               9 and in 1953 became the assistant general manager of the New York Cloak Joint Board
               under Isadore Nagler. After Nagler's death in September 1959, Mendelsund became general
               manager, a post he held until 1973. He also served the union as a vice president,
               and was the director of the International Relations Department from 1968-1980. </div>
            <div class="para"> On April 2, 1973 Mendelsund's recommendation to provide initial funding for the establishment
               of the ILGWU Archives was approved by the New York Cloak Joint Board. Mendelsund assumed
               directorship of the newly created archives, and served as director until his retirement
               on March 31, 1986. It was through Mendelsund's untiring efforts that led to the creation
               of the archives, its professional and prosperous status, and its oral history program.
               He died on September 22, 1994.</div>  </a>

            <div class="para">The International Relations Department of the ILGWU was concerned primarily with outreach
               to foreign and international labor organizations, working conditions in foreign countries,
               and international organizing activities. The department worked closely with international
               relations units of national and international labor confederations, such as the Free
               Trade Union Committee (FTUC) and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions
               (ICFTU). The collection consists of an interview with Henoch Mendelsund by E. Finn
               on August 30, 1978. Included is the typed transcript of the interview as well as the
               audio cassette. From his position as director of the International Relations Department,
               Mendelsund speaks of the union's early and continual interest in international affairs.
               He states that an actual international department was not formed until 1946 with Jay
               Lovestone serving as director until his departure to the AFL-CIO. While a department
               existed intermittently, Mendelsund does not place an emphasis on a formal organizational
               structure for the department as he feels the union was always involved in international
               affairs from its early inception, with or without an actual department. Even in the
               absence of a formal department, he illustrates that the union still had the Committee
               on International Affairs at the conventions, participating in missions, sending people
               to other countries, and collecting funds. Mendelsund discusses the lack of attention
               paid to unions and their involvement with international affairs, labor in respect
               to the State Department, and the role of labor attachs and representatives. Examined
               in the interview is the function and responsibility of unions and labor in international
               relations, as well as international affairs within the AFL-CIO. Mentioned are organizations
               such as the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the Trade
               Union Committee (TUC). Mendelsund concludes by discussing the place of labor in helping
               to organize and support trade unions in developing countries as well as the union's
               projects in Africa, including a trade school, medical equipment, and the generosity
               of members donating funds for union development.</div>  </a>
