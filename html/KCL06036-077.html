            <div class="para">Founded in 1900 by local union delegates representing about 2,000 members in cities
               in the northeastern United States, the ILGWU grew in geographical scope, membership
               size, political influence to become one of the most powerful forces in American organized
               labor by mid-century. Representing workers in the women's garment industry, the ILGWU
               worked to improve working and living conditions of its members through collective
               bargaining agreements, training programs, health care facilities, cooperative housing,
               educational opportunities, and other efforts. In 1995, the ILGWU merged with the Amalgamated
               Clothing and Textile Workers Union (ACTWU) to form the Union of Needletrades, Industrial
               and Textile Employees (UNITE).</div>  </a>

            <div class="para">"Sing me a song with social significance"began the musical comedy revue "Pins and
               Needles." Produced by the Educational Department of the International Ladies' Garment
               Workers' Union (ILGWU), the show with an amateur cast of garment workers won critics
               and audiences to become the longest running musical of the 1930s. </div>
            <div class="para"> The Educational Department began to expand beyond its original function of educating
               workers in labor culture, and soon started to offer recreational outlets for members
               including art, music and dance. In 1934, the department was reorganized under new
               director Mark Starr to create three divisions, Cultural, Recreational and Education,
               managed by Julius Hochman, Louis Schaffer, and Starr respectively. The Cultural Division
               offered classes in drama, acting, dance and music, and also organized a chorus and
               orchestra composed of union members. For years members had been trying to develop
               and present labor themed plays, and while many locals were successful in staging small
               productions, the drama department became formally established in the fall of 1934.
               With Schaffer joining the staff of the ILGWU in October 1934, a dramatic group, the
               ILGWU Players, was formed from members of several locals. Professionals were recruited
               to instruct the classes, and Schaffer envisioned broadening the scope of the department
               to create a venture that brought the labor movement to Broadway. At the American Federation
               of Labor (AFL) Convention in 1935, Schaffer, with the encouragement of ILGWU President
               David Dubinsky, introduced the idea of establishing founding a theater company for
               New York City's labor movement. With enthusiastic support, Labor Stage, Inc. a non-profit
               with revenue supporting the Educational Department, was established in 1935 with financial
               backing from the ILGWU. The union leased the Princess Theatre and began renovating
               the space to become Labor Stage, housing an intimate auditorium, studio and rehearsal
               space and dressing rooms, with a dedication in January 1936. </div>
            <div class="para"> Schaffer soon set to work to make his vision, "Pins and Needles," a realitya revue
               style production that slyly satirized politics and the elite while skewering current
               events staged for working men and women. Harold Rome was brought in to write the music
               and lyrics, numerous writers contributed sketches, and Charles Friedman was hired
               to direct (though he would later be replaced by Robert Gordon). Union members and
               others active in the Educational Department were encouraged to audition, and a cast
               of fifty five garment workers were selected and began extensive rehearsals. The performers
               were not professionals, and in addition to learning their lines and songs, were also
               instructed in the fundamentals of acting and basic stage movement. In June of 1936,
               Schaffer staged an early version of "Pins and Needles" using a professional cast to
               demonstrate the numbers, and though well received, Schaffer chose the unorthodox decision
               to proceed with the cast of untrained garment workers. The official opening was delayed
               for almost a year and a half to make sure the performers, who were still working in
               the factories during the day, had sufficient time to practice and rehearse. </div>
            <div class="para"> On July 4, 1937, the cast traveled to Unity House, the union's vacation resort in
               the Poconos, for additional rehearsals that lasted ten days and concluded with a close
               to completion trial performance of the show. After numerous adjustments and fine tuning,
               "Pins and Needles" held its first invitation only performance at Labor Stage on November
               6, 1937. After additional postponements, finally, on Saturday, November 27, 1937,
               "Pins and Needles" opened to the public. The critics were favorable and with good
               reviews and word of mouth, the show became an instant hit. The box office was busy
               and tickets in high demand, and by January 1938, performances were sold out. Since
               the performers were still working full time in the garment factories, initially the
               show only played on the weekends. The garment workers were given leaves of absence
               from their factory jobs to become full-time actors with pay to accommodate the increased
               show schedule which now included nightly performances. When the primary target audience,
               union members, found it difficult to obtain tickets to see the show, a second performing
               company was organized to provide daily late afternoon matinees for the workers. Close
               to fifty skits were created during the course of "Pins and Needles," of which nineteen
               to twenty-two were performed at each performance, including such favorites as "Sunday
               in the Park," "One Big Union for Two," and "Lesson in Etiquette." Revisions were continually
               made throughout the three editions, with sketches and songs added and deleted as the
               show evolved to adjust and adapt and remain current and timely. </div>
            <div class="para"> While the show ignored references to racial issues on the stage, behind the scenes
               racial inequality abounded. Olive Pearman was the first African American cast in the
               show and initially only had a supporting role and worked as the seamstress on the
               road. Additional African American cast members were added later after pressure on
               Schaffer, including Dorothy Tucker and Dorothy Harrison, but no Hispanics appeared
               in the productions. Other cast members were pressured to suppress their Jewish ethnicities
               and forgo religious observances during performance schedules, some changing names
               and a few altering their appearances. On the road during the touring productions,
               the African American cast members were often forced to follow local segregation laws
               in the cities where they were performing and encountered prejudice in finding accommodations,
               eating with the cast in a restaurant, or in the extreme case, being unable to perform.
               </div>
            <div class="para"> To bring the show to audiences outside of New York City, a ten month national tour
               of "Pins and Needles" began in April 1938 visiting cities Philadelphia, Boston, Los
               Angeles, San Francisco, and Chicago, as well as smaller towns in between as the cast
               made their way across the United States. For many cast members, this was their first
               time traveling away from New York and their families, and especially traversing the
               country on train. Stays in the larger cities were often extended, and in many instances
               the cast was greeted by members from local unions. Multiple companies were formed
               to accommodate the expanding schedule between touring, evenings and matinees. The
               original company went on the national road tour, second and third companies formed
               to perform the evening shows and matinees for union members. As the cast multiplied,
               so did the number of "ringers," or semi-professionals. Schaffer started adding "ringers,"
               talented ILGWU members, and individuals with aspirations to become professional actors
               to replace the initially amateur cast, which created tensions among the various companies.
               </div>
            <div class="para"> In March 1938 in the East Room of the White House, a smaller cast performed for President
               Franklin Roosevelt and Eleanor, whom had already seen the show several times. Afterward,
               the cast and crew performed another condensed version of "Pins and Needles" for the
               twenty-fifth anniversary of the U.S. Department of Labor. The first road show ended
               on January 30, 1939 after 319 performances in 34 cities across the country. The original
               company that was still remaining headed back to New York to find the new casts filling
               all the roles and numerous new numbers added to show. Unfortunately, most of the original
               and road show cast were forced to return back to their jobs in the garment factories
               as many became phased out by semi-professional replacements. The second and revamped
               edition of "Pins and Needles" debuted on April 21, 1939 and on June 26, 1939, the
               show moved to the larger Windsor Theatre. The new edition proved successful, and finally,
               a third edition of the show, "New Pins and Needles," opened on November 20, 1939.
               After 1,108 performances, "Pins and Needles" closed in New York City on June 22, 1940.
               The second national tour began a month later and toured the country before playing
               its last show in Los Angeles on May 31, 1941. After the end of "Pins and Needles,"
               Labor Stage did not put on another play and closed. The actors returned to the shops
               and factories, with only a few trying to turn their experience into a career in show
               business. "Pins and Needles" challenged the idea of labor sponsored entertainment
               to become a popular hit with memorable lyrics, hummable tunes, and a social message
               that appealed to a broad audience.</div>  </a>

            <div class="para">The collection contains personal memorabilia and photo albums of Rose Newmark during
               her time performing in "Pins and Needles." There is a bound photo album, as well as
               pages that were removed from an album, with many images that are identified by location
               on the back. The photographs show sites from various locations, including Unity House,
               most being places traveled to and visited as the show toured different cities. The
               images taken by and of the cast while on tour offer a behind the scenes glimpse of
               the show and life on the road. The photographs also consist of a large number of portraits
               and headshots. There are also many professional publicity photos, including images
               from performances, cast group shots and audience views. </div>
