            <div class="para">The American Federation of Teachers (AFT) was started in Chicago, with eight locals
               signing on as AFL president Samuel Gompers welcomed the union into its fold in 1916.
               </div>
            <div class="para"> AFT grew quickly in the beginning, chartering 174 locals in its first four years.
               The years following World War I saw school boards pressuring and intimidating teachers
               to resign from the union. </div>
            <div class="para"> As membership dropped in the 1920s, the union continued to fight for tenure laws
               and academic freedom of the teachers whose beliefs were being investigated by political
               committees during the 'Red scare" hysteria following WWI. </div>
            <div class="para"> The Depression years were not much better, low salaries and economic insecurity were
               issues needing attention. Female teachers found themselves faced with "contracts which
               still stipulated that an employed teacher must wear skirts of certain lengths, keep
               her galoshes buckled, not receive gentleman callers more than three times a week and
               teach a Sunday School class," said the American Teacher magazine. In some cases teachers
               were dismissed for joining the AFT or for working on school board election campaigns.
               </div>
            <div class="para"> By 1932, the Norris-La Guardia Act outlawed yellow dog contracts, which made teachers
               promise not to join the union. </div>
            <div class="para"> Starting with WWII the AFT worked hard to push war bond sales, war relief and air
               raid programs in schools. After the war the AFT continued to fight to improve the
               conditions of the schools and their teachers. </div>
            <div class="para"> In the 1950s, loyalty oaths started up again. The AFT continued work on the civil
               rights movement, filing an amicus curiae brief in the historic 1954 Supreme Court
               desegregation case Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, and expelling locals that
               had not followed an earlier mandate to desegregate. </div>
            <div class="para"> During the 1960s, besides fighting for civil rights, the AFT and its affiliates worked
               at getting collective bargaining agreements with stubborn school boards. Also the
               first major strike by university professors in the United States and a one-day walkout
               by the United Federation of Teachers in New York City took place. Over 300 teacher
               strikes occurred throughout the country during the 10 years following the UFT's walkout.
               The national AFT grew from less than 60,000 members in 1960 to over 200,000 by the
               end of the decade.</div>  </a>
