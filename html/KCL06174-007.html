            <div class="para">New York State United Teachers (NYSUT) was created in 1972 by the merger of the New
               York State Teachers Association (NYSTA) and the United Teachers of New York (UTNY).
               NYSTA had been affiliated with the National Education Association (NEA), and UTNY
               with the American Federation of Teachers (AFT). UTNY was the statewide organization
               whose United Federation of Teachers (UFT), led by Albert Shanker, was the predominant
               teachers' union in New York City. In joining with United Teachers and affiliating
               with the AFT, NYSUT also became a member union of the AFL-CIO. </div>
            <div class="para"> In 1976, NYSUT voted to disaffiliate with the NEA. Some locals left NYSUT and created
               the NYEA (New York Educators Association), which became the state affiliate for the
               NEA. In the early 1980s, NYEA changed its name to NEA-NY. </div>
            <div class="para"> NYEA/NEA- NY viewed association with the AFL-CIO's industrial unions as undermining
               the professional image and independence of teachers. The two organizations also differed
               strongly on aspects of the governance structure, particularly with respect to ethnic
               minority representation, with NYSUT opposed to mandatory minimums. The rivalry between
               NYSUT and NYEA/NEA-NY in organizing new locals expended a great deal of resources
               for both labor organizations. </div>
            <div class="para"> While competition with NYEA/NEA-NY was a constant focus of NYSUT's organizing efforts
               for teachers, NYSUT was also organizing college faculty members, nurses, and other
               non-teaching personnel. Once members were organized, NYSUT continued to advocate for
               teachers' and other workers' rights through contract support and legal services at
               the local level and political involvement at the state and federal levels, supporting
               candidates and legislation that protected funding, due process, and working conditions.
               </div>
            <div class="para"> NEA-N Y merged with NYSUT in 2006, by which time NYSUT had grown to more than half
               a million members, becoming the largest union in New York State.</div>  </a>

            <div class="para">Covers the period 1976-1994. The NYS Special Task Force on Equity and Excellence in
               Education (also known as the Rubin Commission or Rubin Task Force, named for its chairman,
               Max J. Rubin) was created to make recommendations for a state aid formula that would
               more fairly fund school districts, taking into account the great disparities in local
               wealth throughout the state. Materials in this collection focus mostly on the NYSUT
               committee that tracked the task force's work, the NYSUT Commission on Equitable Public
               School Funding. Meeting agendas and minutes, position papers, and correspondence comprise
               the bulk of the files, along with analyses of the 1978 NY Supreme Court decision (and
               the Appellate Division decision in 1981) in Levittown v. Nyquist, which found the
               current school aid formula unconstitutional. Files also include materials of the Task
               Force on Creating Career Pathways for New York State Youth, appointed by Governor
               Mario Cuomo in 1991 and co-chaired by NYSUT president Tom Hobart and Regent Walter
               Cooper of Rochester. The task force examined school-to-work transitions for students
               at risk of dropping out, including a proposal to replace the Regents general diploma
               with a Career Pathways Certificate at age 16 and establish alternative learning environments
               for students beyond the age of mandatory attendance. Finally, a large number of files
               reflect the work of the Curriculum and Assessment Council and its many subcommittees,
               which advised the State Education Department on its school restructuring initiative,
               A New Compact for Learning. Detailed critiques by NYSUT vice president Antonia Cortese,
               who was a member of the group, give insight into the level of concern by the teachers
               union for rigorous academic standards.</div>  </a>
