            <div class="para">A joint legislative committee was established by a concurrent resolution in both houses
               of the New York State Legislature to inquire into manufacturing and labor conditions
               was established on February 25, 1926. Senator James C Truman was named chairman and
               Henry D. Sayer served as counsel and executive secretary of the committee. </div>
            <div class="para"> The committee held hearings on the operations of the State Department of Labor, the
               Bureau of Workmen's Compensation, the State Placement Service and the efforts of state
               and New York City officials to regulate private employment agencies. </div>
            <div class="para"> On January 23, 1928 Governor Alfred E. Smith appointed Lindsay Rogers, Professor
               of Public Law and Government at Columbia University the thirty-third Moreland Commissioner
               to investigate the operations of the State Department of Labor and the Bureau of Workmen's
               Compensation Insurance. It was Governor Smith's opinion that the Joint Committee was
               being used by the Republican Legislature in an attempt to discredit a Democratic governor.
               </div>
            <div class="para"> The Moreland Act of 1907 was an attempt by the proponents of good government to prevent
               special interests from influencing public policy. The act gave the Governor power
               to investigate the activities and administration of any department, bureau or division
               of the state. Although the funds were appropriated by the Legislature, disbursement
               was to be at the direction of the governor, who was given all the power possible under
               the Constitution to institute and carry out such inquiries as he deemed important.
               </div>
            <div class="para"> When the Legislature learned of Roger's appointment it asserted that Governor Smith
               sought to "white wash" his Administration of these departments and extended the life
               of its Committee to March 12, 1928 and later to March 1, 1929. A split between Senate
               Assembly Republicans, however, also produced a resolution instructing the Committee
               to cooperate with the Moreland Commissioner. </div>
            <div class="para"> Rogers presented his report on the first and fifteenth of June,1928. The Chairman
               of the Committee, James C. Truman asserted in an open letter on the twenty-seventh
               that Rogers gave the impression that all was well in the Department of Labor, although
               he had found as much mismanagement as the Legislative Committee. Rogers was invited
               to appear before the Committee to discuss the activities of the Department and his
               suggestions for reform. Rogers submitted his final report on December 1, 1928. </div>
            <div class="para"> In the meantime, on May 28, 1928, the Supreme Court of the United States decided
               in the case of Rebnik vs. McBride (277 U. S. 350) that, while the state had the power
               to license and regulate the business of an employment agent, it was not affected with
               a public interest so as to allow the state to fix charges for the service.</div>  </a>
