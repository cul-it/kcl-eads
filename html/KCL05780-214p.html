            <div class="para">Founded in 1900 by local union delegates representing about 2,000 members in cities
               in the northeastern United States, the ILGWU grew in geographical scope, membership
               size, political influence to become one of the most powerful forces in American organized
               labor by mid-century. Representing workers in the women's garment industry, the ILGWU
               worked to improve working and living conditions of its members through collective
               bargaining agreements, training programs, health care facilities, cooperative housing,
               educational opportunities, and other efforts. In 1995, the ILGWU merged with the Amalgamated
               Clothing and Textile Workers Union (ACTWU) to form the Union of Needletrades, Industrial
               and Textile Employees (UNITE).</div>  </a>

            <p></p>
            
            <div class="para">The ILGWU Chorus was an organization within the ILGWU that brought together union
               members to perform songs for television and radio, and at conventions and other public
               events. Under the direction of Malcolm Dodds, the ILGWU Chorus was probably most-widely
               known for its performances of "Look for the Union Label" on television commercials
               in the mid-1970s. The song, written by Paula Green and composed by Malcolm Dodds,
               was part of the ILGWU's general campaign to educate the public about the union label,
               the work of the ILGWU, and the importance of both to consumers and workers alike.
               The ILGWU Chorus appeared at ILGWU conventions, AFL-CIO conventions, community and
               political events, and the group sang songs in Chinese, English, French, and Spanish.</div>
            <div class="para"> Local unions, district councils, and regional departments also organized choruses,
               and in many instances, these groups pre-dated the ILGWU Chorus that gained national
               recognition in the 1970s. These smaller groups performed at local and regional meetings,
               community events, and sometimes at the ILGWU's international conventions. The musical
               revue, "My Name Is Mary Brown," for example, was performed by the Northeast Department
               at the ILGWU's Golden Jubilee Convention in 1950. Along with orchestras, theater groups,
               sports teams, and others, these choruses were one part of the union's active educational
               departments.</div>  </a>
         
         <hr><a name="a3">
            
            
            <div class="para">The records of the ILGWU Chorus consist primarily of sheet music, and minimal records
               relating to the chorus including attendance lists and administrative aspects of the
               group's performances. The photographs of the ILGWU Chorus include images from the
               group, as well as portraits of the chorus director Malcolm Dodds. </div>
            <div class="para"> The ILGWU Chorus records and photographs at the Kheel Center document a very small
               fraction of the work of the group, thus researchers would do well to review other
               parts of the ILGWU Records for further documentation. Researchers should consider
               review the Report and Record of Proceedings of the ILGWU's conventions after 1975.
               These records of proceedings provide some general information about the work of the
               organization, and when they chorus performed, they list the songs performed. Also
               of interest are recordings of Union Label commercials in the ILGWU Audio-Visual Collection
               (5780 AV). These include several of the different commercials that were televised
               as part of the Union Label Campaign.</div>  </a>
