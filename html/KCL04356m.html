            <div class="para">Alice Hanson Cook (1903 - 1998) devoted her life to helping working people, and especially
               working women, on four continents. What she herself called her "patchwork career"
               included social work, adult education, labor organizing, a tour of foreign service
               at the end of World War II, twenty years teaching in Cornell's School of Industrial
               and Labor Relations, and authoring numerous books and articles. She was a pioneer
               in bringing attention to issues such as comparable worth, maternity leave, and pay
               equity, known for both her scholarly writings and her activism on the experiences
               of working women around the world. </div>
            <div class="para"> Alice attended Northwestern University's School of Speech from 1920-1924, gaining
               her only formal degree. (She would later receive a number of honorary doctorates,
               including one from Northwestern.) While enrolled at Northwestern, Alice began her
               studies of both economics and social work, as well as beginning her lifelong attachment
               to the ideals of socialism. Early employment with the YWCA's Industrial Department
               in the 1920s led her to find ways to use the Y for both union support efforts and
               attempts to organize women workers previously ignored by unions, such as domestic
               servants. These early efforts with the Y led to Alice's involvement with adult labor
               education efforts such as the Bryn Mawr Summer School for Women Workers, Arkansas'
               Commonwealth College, the Southern Summer School for Workers in North Carolina, and
               the Hudson Shore School. They also led to her first direct employment by the union
               movement, as she worked for the early CIO's Textile Workers' Organizing Committee.
               </div>
            <div class="para"> The 1930s and 40s also mark the beginning of Alice's interests in similar developments
               around the world. From 1929 to 1931, she studied in Germany under a DAAD (Deutscher
               Akademischer Austauschdienst) fellowship, beginning her long association with the
               German system of adult and labor education. She would return to Germany after World
               War II, when she became the chief of adult education in Germany's American Zone for
               the Education Division of the High Commission, Germany. Her travels through Germany
               at this time combined with her own personal experiences led her to become intrigued
               with questions of comparative systems of labor education. She would ultimately travel
               throughout both Western and Eastern Europe as well as Asia in order to carry out her
               research. </div>
            <div class="para"> Alice's academic career began in 1952, when she was hired by the New York State School
               of Industrial and Labor Relations at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y. She began
               as a researcher in the School's extension division, but moved into a full academic
               teaching position in 1955. She served as a well-respected teacher in the School up
               to her retirement in 1972.</div>  </a>
