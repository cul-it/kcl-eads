            <div class="para">On October 18, 1945, Mayor O'Dwyer of New York City suggested that the use of collective
               bargaining might alleviate the friction between the Board of Transportation and the
               transit employees. It was not until 1950, however, when Michael J. Quill, President
               of the Transport Workers Union, demanded immediate contract negotiations with the
               Board of Transportation, that this issue came to the forefront. Quill had circulated
               a petition among the transit workers calling for these negotiations, and claimed that
               21,834 of the 27,000 employees had supported his stand. </div>
            <div class="para"> Other T.W.U. demands were a $2-a-day raise for all transit employees, increased overtime
               pay, an improved pension plan, and additional vacation days after five years of service.
               The Greater New York CIO requested that the present grievance procedure of the BoT
               be modified. Conversely, the BoT argued that it did not have the funds to meet these
               demands. Mayor O'Dwyer offered to set up a fact-finding board to hear the complaints
               of each side, and both the Board of Transportation and the Transport Workers Union
               agreed to submit their cases before this impartial board. </div>
            <div class="para"> The Board was appointed by Mayor William O'Dwyer on January 9, 1950. David L. Cole
               was appointed as chairman of the Board, and Theodore W. Kheel, Thomas A. Morgan, and
               Edward P. Mulrooney were appointed as Board members. The hearings began on April 12,
               1950. </div>
            <div class="para"> The findings of the Board may be found in its printed <a target="_top" HREF="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=coo.31924002357584;view=1up;seq=1;size=175">Report to Honorable William O'Dwyer, Mayor of the City of New York, May 31, 1950</a>.</div>  </a>
