            <div class="para">In May of 1950, Abraham Feingold, a mathematics teacher at Manual Training High School
               in Brooklyn, was suspended from his job for refusing to answer a question, submitted
               by the superintendent of schools to all New York City school teachers, as to whether
               he was or had ever been a communist. Feingold was one of eight New York City teachers
               who refused to answer the question. All were suspended by the superintendent of schools.
               In the fall of that year, the suspensions were upheld, and on appeal by the State
               Education Commissioner, Abraham Feingold and the seven other defendants were permanently
               removed from the New York school system. </div>
            <div class="para">In addition to refusing to answer the question as to past or present communist affiliation,
               all eight defendants were Jewish, and charges of anti-Semitism on the part of the
               superintendent of schools were prominent throughout the controversy.</div>
            <div class="para">Abraham Feingold was born in Ukraine on March 20, 1900 and moved to the United Sattes
               when he was 9 years old. He received his BA from COlumbia Univeristy, and his Master's
               of Education from Teachers College of Columbia University. He passed away on SPetember
               14, 1970.</div>  </a>
