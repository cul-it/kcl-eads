            <div class="para">Founded in 1900 by local union delegates representing about 2,000 members in cities
               in the northeastern United States, the ILGWU grew in geographical scope, membership
               size, political influence to become one of the most powerful forces in American organized
               labor by mid-century. Representing workers in the women's garment industry, the ILGWU
               worked to improve working and living conditions of its members through collective
               bargaining agreements, training programs, health care facilities, cooperative housing,
               educational opportunities, and other efforts. In 1995, the ILGWU merged with the Amalgamated
               Clothing and Textile Workers Union (ACTWU) to form the Union of Needletrades, Industrial
               and Textile Employees (UNITE).</div>  </a>

            <div class="para">Isidor Stenzor (spelling variations include Isidore and Steinzor) was born on March
               3, 1893 in Kassov, Poland, and arrived in the United States in October of 1909. Soon
               after, he found work in a men's clothing factory as an operator, enduring long hours,
               low wages, and horrible conditions. After initially becoming involved in various garment
               operator unions and locals from the United Garment Workers to the Amalgamated Clothing
               Workers, in 1915, Stenzor joined the ILGWU and New York Cloak Operators Local 1. He
               held numerous union positions in New York, including an Executive Board member of
               Local 1, Chairman of the Cloak and Dress Joint Board, and Manager of the Price Adjustment
               Department of the New York Cloak Joint Board. He then moved to Canada to become the
               Manager of the Montreal Cloak Joint Board from 1939-1943. In 1950, Stenzor was appointed
               the Manager of the Los Angeles Cloak Joint Board, a position he held until his retirement.
               </div>
            <div class="para"> Stenzor was active in many organizations, including Chairman of the Jewish Labor
               Committee for the Pacific Coast Region and active in the Workmen's Circle and Jewish
               Socialist Federation. Stenzor died on March 27, 1988 at the age of 95.</div>  </a>

            <div class="para">The collection of Isidor Stenzor covers the years between 1920 through the 1970s providing
               information on both his professional activity for the ILGWU as well as his personal
               activities and engagements. A large portion of the collection is in Yiddish. There
               is general union correspondence, reports and statements for various committees and
               Joint Boards of which Stenzor was involved. Also included are clippings, articles
               and statements regarding the centralization of control in the garment industry. The
               Uniform Industrial Control Plan aimed at allowing one business agent to gain control
               over a manufacturer as well as the inside shop and contractors. According to the plan
               and the included report, the business agent would have complete supervision by holding
               meetings, listening to complaints, and settling prices. </div>
            <div class="para"> Additionally, a significant amount of the collection contains material collected
               during Stenzor's time as a communist. From the Communist Party and Communist Party
               of the USA, there are mailings, letters, statements, information from meetings, doctrines,
               bulletins, and expulsion of members. Much of the correspondence involves Jay Lovestone
               and Charles Zimmerman. There are requests for Stenzor to appear before the party in
               regards to the merger of the Cloakmakers Progressive League with the Trade Union Center
               and other involvements with Cloakmakers Local 1. Also included is material from the
               Council of Needle Trades Progressive Groups and the Independent Labor League of America
               (a Constitution and a Discussion Bulletin). The collection contains material regarding
               anti-war activities, including information, correspondence, flyers and meeting minutes
               for the group "Keep America Out of War," in which Stenzor was a member of the New
               York Council before resigning.</div>  </a>
