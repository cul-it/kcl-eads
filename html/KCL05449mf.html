            <div class="para">The Pullman Strike was a nationwide railroad strike and boycott that took place from
               May 11, 1894 to August 1894. </div>
            <div class="para"> The Pullman Palace Car Company built railroad cars at its main factory just south
               of Chicago, Illinois, in the company town of Pullman. The majority of Pullman employees
               lived in the company town. As a company town, all housing, shops, churches, libraries,
               and other civic institutions were owned by the Pullman Company, which set the rates
               of rent, groceries, and other amenities. After the Panic of 1893 and the ensuing financial
               depression, the Pullman Company faced decreased demand for their product and in response
               slashed wages by about 25 percent while making no changes to the cost of living for
               their employees. The employees, fearing starvation, approached the owner of the company,
               George Pullman, to try to negotiate a solution. However, Mr. Pullman declined to make
               any changes or to engage in arbitration. In response, the Pullman employees walked
               off the job on May 11, 1894. Although only about 35 percent of the Pullman employees
               were represented by the American Railway Union [ARU] at the time of the walkout, the
               ARU and its president, Eugene V. Debs, promised to support the Pullman manufacturing
               workers in any action they took. Notably, the ARU did not extend the same courtesy
               to the African-American sleeping car porters employed by the Pullman Company. </div>
            <div class="para"> To support the Pullman employees who walked off the job, the ARU launched a nationwide
               boycott in which ARU members refused to run any train containing a Pullman car. By
               the end of June 1894, over 125,000 railroad workers on 29 different lines had walked
               off the job. The hope was that the railroad companies would force Pullman to compromise
               with his employees. Instead, the railroad companies coordinated their response, made
               sure that every train, passenger or freight, was pulling a Pullman car, and began
               hiring strikebreakers. </div>
            <div class="para"> The ARU members on strike had agreed to continue to operate trains carrying U.S.
               mail, if there were no Pullman cars attached to the same train. The railroad companies'
               decision to add a Pullman car to every train meant that U.S. mail was not being delivered,
               and gave the federal government a pretext to intervene. Additionally, there was mounting
               public pressure to intervene as the strike and the boycott effectively crippled all
               railroads west of Chicago and rioting, vandalism, and looting became associated with
               the actions of the strikers. In early July, President Grover Cleveland sent troops
               to Chicago to break up the strike. At the same time, Eugene V. Debs was placed under
               injunction by circuit court judges, preventing him or other union leaders from communicating
               with their members. Debs, who had been urging restraint and decrying violence to his
               members, was suddenly unable to legally communicate with them and dissuade them from
               rash actions. </div>
            <div class="para"> The arrival of the federal troops in Chicago on July 3, 1894 infuriated the strikers,
               and they and their sympathizers responded by destroying railroad property, overturning
               railcars, and creating barriers to block the troops from reaching the train yards.
               Violence exploded in the south side of Chicago, and at rail yards around the country,
               as the strikers and the federal troops clashed. Thirty strikers were killed, fifty-seven
               were wounded, over $80 million in property damage was caused, and the strikers had
               lost more than $1 million in wages. </div>
            <div class="para"> Thanks to the intervention of the federal government, the strike was effectively
               broken by mid-July, and the Pullman employees returned to their jobs in August after
               agreeing to sign a pledge that they would never again try to join a union.</div>  </a>

            <div class="para"> This collection consists of the microfilm copy of a detailed report on the Pullman
               Strike of 1894. It includes an introductory analysis of Eugene V. Debs, George W.
               Howard, and a history of the American Railway Union. The report also recounts the
               history of the events preceding the strike and relates a day-by-day narrative of the
               strike. The report discusses officers and employees who were prominent in serving
               the company during the strike. Finally, the report offers a statistical analysis of
               the events, the strike's effect on business, and an essay discussing possible long-term
               consequences of the strike. This report was written on behalf of a railroad company,
               so there is a strong anti-labor bias throughout the report. </div>
