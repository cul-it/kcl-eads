            <div class="para">The International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union was once one of the largest labor
               unions in the United States founded in 1900 by local union delegates representing
               about 2,000 members in cities in the northeastern United States. It was one of the
               first U.S. Unions to have a membership consisting of mostly females, and it played
               a key role in the labor history of the 1920s and 1930s. The union is generally referred
               to as the "ILGWU" or the "ILG". The ILGWU grew in geographical scope, membership size,
               and political influence to become one of the most powerful forces in American organized
               labor by mid-century. Representing workers in the women's garment industry, the ILGWU
               worked to improve working and living conditions of its members through collective
               bargaining agreements, training programs, health care facilities, cooperative housing,
               educational opportunities, and other efforts. The ILGWU merged with the Amalgamated
               Clothing and Textile Workers Union in 1995 to form the Union of Needle trades, Industrial
               and Textile Employees (UNITE). UNITE merged with the Hotel Employees and Restaurant
               Employees Union (HERE) in 2004 to create a new union known as UNITE HERE. The two
               unions that formed UNITE in 1995 represented only 250,000 workers between them, down
               from the ILGWU's peak membership of 450,000 in 1969.</div>  </a>

            <div class="para">Jay Mazur was the last president of the ILGWU, serving from 1986 to 1995. </div>
            <div class="para"> After graduating from high school in 1951, Mazur began work in the Health and Welfare
               Department of New York City's dressmaker's Local 22. In 1955, Mazur entered the ILGWU's
               Training Institute, a 1-year intensive program to prepare students for staff appointments
               in the ILGWU, and was assigned as an organizer in the Upper South Department and the
               New England Region. After graduation in 1956, Mazur was assigned to Local 40, where
               he became Director of Organization and Education. </div>
            <div class="para"> In 1959, Mazur began working for Local 23, which later merged with Local 25 to become
               Local 23-25. Mazur began work as an organizer for the local in 1959, was elected as
               Assistant Manager in 1964, and manager in 1973. He became a Vice-President of the
               International in 1977. During his tenure in Local 23 and 23-25, Mazur was involved
               in major organizing efforts, as well as significant social and educational programs
               for union members. He was manager of Local 23-25 in 1982, when thousands of workers
               in New York City's Chinatown went on strike to win a fair contract. Under his leadership,
               Local 23-25 established an Immigration Project to assist members and their families
               with legal and related immigration issues. While working for the union, Mazur earned
               his an undergraduate degree in Personnel and Labor Studies from City College of New
               York, and later a master's degree in Labor Studies from Rutgers University. </div>
            <div class="para"> In 1983, Mazur was elected to the International's leadership as Secretary-Treasurer,
               and in 1986, he was elected to succeed Sol Chaikin as President of the ILGWU. During
               his tenure as President, Mazur led major campaigns to stem the decline of garment
               manufacturing in the United States. This included the creation of the ILGWU's Professional
               and Clerical Employees (PACE) Division and the Metro Organizing Department, the expansion
               of the Immigration Project to be national in scope, and the establishment of workers
               centers in major metropolitan centers. Mazur served on the Executive Councils of the
               AFL-CIO, and the AFL-CIO's Industrial Union Department of the AFL-CIO; in addition
               to his work in domestic and international labor federations, he has also served on
               numerous foundation boards and government commissions. </div>
            <div class="para"> Under Mazur's leadership, the ILGUW merged with the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile
               Workers of America to form the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees
               (UNITE) in 1995. He served as the first president of UNITE, from 1995 until his retirement
               in 2001.</div>  </a>
