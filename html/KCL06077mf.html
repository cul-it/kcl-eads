            <div class="para">Elizabeth Glendower Evans (February 28, 1856-December 12, 1937), was born Elizabeth
               Gardiner in New Rochelle, New York, the fourth of five children of Edward and Sophia
               Harrison (Mifflin) Gardiner. Evans's father died when she was three years old and,
               as she writes in her "Memoir," "We were imported to Boston by my father's father,
               William Howard Gardiner, where we grew up as poor relations of a very aristocratic
               family." After two years in Brookline Mrs. Gardiner moved her family into Boston.
               Evans attended private schools; in her teens, "Going to church became my one interest."
               She attended Trinity Church, where she was inspired by the teachings of Phillips Brooks.
               Evans taught Sunday school and planned to become a missionary until, in 1877, she
               met Glendower Evans (GE), then a student at Harvard College and a close friend of
               William James. They were married in 1882, after GE had finished Harvard Law School
               and entered a Boston law firm. </div>
            <div class="para"> Their marriage was brief because GE died suddenly in 1886. During these four years,
               according to Evans's "Memoir," the "doors were always open to the friends he made.
               In those days I don't think I ever talked at all. I used to sit by the fire and listen
               and listen...." The friends she listened to included Louis Brandeis and William James,
               but it was her husband who had the greatest influence on Evans. From their first meeting
               he encouraged her to read more widely; literature, politics, social issues, and public
               service were the major topics of his letters and their discussions. After Glendower
               Evans's death Elizabeth added his name to hers and dedicated her life to studying
               social conditions and helping others. </div>
            <div class="para"> Some of the activities Elizabeth was involved with are as follows: Trustee, Massachusetts
