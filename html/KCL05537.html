            <div class="para">The New York, Chicago, and St. Louis Railway Company, more commonly known as the Nickel
               Plate Road [NKP], was founded in 1881. It ran along the southern shore of the Great
               Lakes, connecting Buffalo to Chicago, running through Cleveland and Fort Wayne. The
               Nickel Plate Road was a successful railroad, operating over 1600 miles of track in
               the Midwestern region of the United States at its peak. </div>
            <div class="para"> In 1916, the Van Sweringen brothers purchased the Nickel Plate; they then expanded
               their railroad through the acquisitions of the Lake Erie and Western Railroad and
               the Toledo, St. Louis and Western Railroad, which was known as the Cloverleaf. These
               purchases expanded the reach of the Nickel Plate to Peoria, Illinois and to St. Louis
               and Toledo, respectively. The three lines were consolidated into one company in 1923.
               An additional consolidation with the Pere Marquette Railway and the Chesapeake and
               Ohio railroad was proposed in 1924, but was ultimately rejected by the Interstate
               Commerce Commission in 1926. In 1949, the Nickel Plate Road signed a ninety-nine year
               lease for the Wheeling and Lake Erie Railroad, granting it access to the mid-Atlantic
               states and the coal fields located there. </div>
            <div class="para"> The Nickel Plate remained a solvent business through the 1950s, but in 1964 due to
               the increasing financial pressures on the railroad industry, it merged with six other
               railroads into the Norfolk and Western Railroad.</div>  </a>
         
         <hr><a name="a3">
            
            
            <div class="para">Inclusive date range: 1890-1962 </div>
            <div class="para"> Bulk dates: 1921-1948 </div>
            <div class="para"> The collection contains records from the Nickel Plate Road. The bulk of the records
               are grievance reports filed by the employees' unions, and then the resulting correspondence
               between company managers, superintendents, union representatives, and the employees.
               Extensive internal communication between various divisions of the Nickel Plate is
               also documented. The correspondence also contains documentation of the various rules
               and regulations that are were agreed upon between the management and unions in their
               contracts. Other agreements include those between various railroad unions and both
               the Pere Marquette Railway Company and the Lake Erie and Western Railroad, both of
               which were controlled by the then owners of the Nickel Plate Road. Of particular interest
               is the twenty-six year grievance process regarding the types of seating present in
               the train engines, and which class of employee had rights to which particular seat;
               these records include hand-drawn renderings of the types of seats thought to be appropriate
               by various interested parties.</div>  </a>
