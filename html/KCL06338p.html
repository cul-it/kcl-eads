            <div class="para">David P. Miller was born in Cleveland, Ohio on June 21, 1919. After serving nearly
               five years in the US Army during World War II he received a BS from the University
               of Arizona in 1948. This degree was followed by an MBA from the University of California
               at Berkeley in 1950. </div>
            <div class="para"> After a brief employment by the US Department of Labor as a wage economist in 1950
               Miller became an Impartial Manager for the Ford-UAW retirement board, a position he
               held until his death. He was also an Associate Umpire for Ford and the UAW from 1952
               to 1959, and the Ad Hoc S.U.B. Plan Chairman from 1958 on. Unfortunately the Ford-UAW
               representatives decided not to cite Associate Umpire awards in their arbitrations,
               only Umpire awards. This meant that Miller's roughly 1,000 memorandum decisions never
               served as precedents in later cases. </div>
            <div class="para"> Miller served as an Umpire and Arbitrator for US Steel and the United Steelworkers
               of America from 1962 on. He was also an Umpire for the Aluminum Company of America
               (ALCO) and the Aluminum Workers International Union (1965 on), the Budd Company and
               the UAW (1971 on), and the Borroughs Corporation and the UAW (1964-1965). By his estimate
               he wrote about 2,000 Umpire decisions. </div>
            <div class="para"> His ad hoc arbitration dealt mostly with newspaper and communication workers. Some
               of the unions involved were the CWA, OCAW, Pressmen, Typographers, IBEW, and Machinists.
               By his estimate he wrote about 1,000 ad hoc decisions. </div>
            <div class="para"> Miller was a member and on the arbitration panels of the American Academy of Arbitrators
               and the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. He was a member of the Industrial
               Relations Research Association, the Society of Professionals in Dispute Resolution
               (SPIDR), and the National Academy of Arbitrators (NAA). Miller served the NAA in several
               capacities: Executive Secretary (1962-1968), member of the Board of Governors (1968-1971),
               Vice-President (1972-1973), President-Elect (1973-1974), and President (1974-1975).
