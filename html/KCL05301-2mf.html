            <div class="para">In a system of interstate, district, subdistrict, and local agreements, questions
               concerning the proper interpretation of the many provisions bound to arise. Disagreements
               developed concerning alleged violations of the contract, non-compliance with its provisions,
               or matters not directly covered in the agreement. The district and subdistrict contracts
               specified how such disputes or grievances of either the miners or the operators should
               be handled. This record group contains materials having to do with only that adjustment
               procedure which has developed in District 12 during the period 1900 to 1927, although
               procedures were generally similar throughout the entire Central Competitive Field.
               </div>
            <div class="para"> An Illinois miner who felt agrieved with some condition of work or some action of
               the management first discussed his grievance with the pit boss or mine foreman. If
               he failed to receive satisfaction from the foreman, he referred his complaint to the
               pit committee. Each mine had a pit committee. Each mine had a pit committee, usually
               composed of three men, elected by the local union. The pit committee attempted to
               adjust the grievance with the mine manager. It has been estimated that the pit committees
               settled approximately 70 per cent of the case which were brought to them. In the earlier
               days of collective bargaining, the pit committee was the sole judge in the disposition
               of disputes. If the pit committee could not reach an agreement with the mine management,
               it ordered a strike and fought the matter out. </div>
            <div class="para"> As the bargaining relationship matured, the methods of settlement were expanded and
               more steps were added to the adjustment procedure. Disputes upon which the pit committee
               and the mine manager could not agree were passed on to the president or vice-president
               of the subdistrict union and the superintendent of the mine where the dispute occurred.
               If they failed to agree, the dispute was submitted in writing to the executive board
               member of the district union and a commissioner of the operators' association. The
               case description cited evidence which had been agreed upon by the mine superintendent
               and the subdistrict president. </div>
            <div class="para"> District 12 was divided into ten executive board election districts which are not
               to be confused with the subdistricts. The election districts were not coextensive
               with the subdistricts. The executive board election districts were divided with due
               regard to number of members, while subdistrict divisions wwere based upn geologic
               structure and mining conditions. The operators' commissioner and executive board member
               often held hearings at the mines to settle cases referred to them. In case of disagreement,
               the commissioner and board member submitted in writing such evidence as they could
               agree upon to a joint group board. </div>
            <div class="para"> During the time period covered by this record group, there were five joint group
               boards operative in Illinois. Each board was composed of an equal number, usually
               eight, of representatives of the union and of the operators. On three of these boards,
               the operators eight representatives were named by the Ilinois Coal Operators' Association;
               on the fourth by the Coal Operators' Association of the Fifth and Ninth Districts;
               and on the fifth by the Central Illinois Coal Operators' Association. </div>
            <div class="para"> The jurisdiction of Joint Group Board No. 1 was the northern field of Illinois; Joint
               Group Board No. 2 was comprised of representatives from the central portion of the
               state; while Joint Group Board No. 3 served the southern Illinois field. Joint Group
               Board No. 4 served the jurisdiction of the Coal Operators' Association of the Fifth
               and Ninth Districts, and Joint Group Board No. 5 that of the Central Illinois coal
               Operators' Association. </div>
            <div class="para"> The fifth joint group board seldom if ever met. If the commissioner of the CICOA
               and the district executive board member of the Springfield district failed to agree,
               the case was referred to the presidents of the District union and the operators' association
               who appointed a commission to settle the dispute. If this commission failed to agree,
               the fifth joint group board cases were most often submitted directly to arbitration.
               </div>
            <div class="para"> In cases before a joint group board, the executive board member and commissioner
               who referred the case to the board presented the case and offered the arguments for
               each side. Occasionally witnesses were called before the board, but usually only written
               evidence was submitted to a joint group board. A dispute before a joint group board
               could be permanently or temporarily disposed of in the following ways: </div>
            <div class="para"> 1.It could be closed by either denying or granting the demand of the claimant. </div>
            <div class="para"> 2.It could be referred back to the commissioner and executive board member who brought
               the case before the board with instructions to gather more evidence and act accordingly.
               </div>
            <div class="para"> 3.It could be dropped for lack of evidence. </div>
            <div class="para"> 4.It could be referred to a special commission. </div>
            <div class="para"> 5.It could be referred to the full joint board. </div>
            <div class="para"> 6.It could be referred to arbitration. </div>
            <div class="para"> 7.It could be withdrawn by theminers for "independent action". </div>
            <div class="para"> As just described, the board could refer any dispute to a special commission appointed
               by the board. The commission usually consisted of two executive board members of the
               union and two commissioners of the operators' association, although it sometimes included
               only the presidents of the respective organizations. If the parties wished to have
               a case decided without setting a precedent for future cases, the dispute was submitted
               to a commission which decided the case outside the joint group board meeting and did
               not record its decision. </div>
            <div class="para"> Important cases were sometimes submitted by a joint group board to the Full Joint
               Executive Board which consisted of all the executive board members of District 12
               and the entire governing executive board of the Illinois Coal Operators' Association.
               When the full board disagreed, the case was often referred to the presidents of the
               two organizations or again to a special commission appointed by the full board. In
               the event that no agreement was reached at this step, the dispute was either submitted
               to final and binding arbitration or withdrawn by the miners for "independent action".
               A case could, however, proceed to either of these last steps directly from action
               by a joint group board.</div>  </a>

               incompetence, hours of work, improper dismissal, compensation for management negligence,
               and fringe benefits. The board was also called upon to interpret existing contracts
               and agreements.</div>  </a>
