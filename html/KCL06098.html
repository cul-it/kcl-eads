            <div class="para">Tom Darcy was born in Brokklyn, NY in 1932. He received his art education at the school
               of Visual Arts in New York. In 1958 he began his editorial cartooning with Newsday
               on Long Island. In 1970, Darcy was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for his incisive cartoons
               of the Vietnam War and racial discrimination. He won many awards in 1970's, some of
               these were: Best Cartoon on Froeign Affairs in 1970 &amp; 1973, Meeman Conservation Award
               in 1972 &amp; 1974 as well as the National Headliners' Club award in 1974.</div>  </a>

            <div class="para">The Sidney Hillman Foundation was named for the labor leader, Sidney Hillman (1887-1946),
               who was the first president of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America (ACWA).
               Immediately after his death, his union wished to honor him with a memorial that would
               carry on his commitments to the lives of working people. On November 17, 1946, the
               General Executive Board of the ACWA voted to establish the Sidney Hillman Foundation.
               ACWA contributed the first $100,000 and then raised one million dollars from other
               organizations. In 1947, the Board of Directors issued the first grants for scholarships,
               research and lectures on college campuses, and for medical research at the Sidney
               Hillman Health Centers. </div>
            <div class="para"> In 1950, the Foundation launched the Hillman Prize in order to promote socially-responsible
               journalism. Starting with awards in Book, Magazine, Newspaper, and Broadcast, the
               prize is now also offered in the categories of Photojournalism, Web, and Opinion and
               Analysis. One important note is that the Hillman Foundation changed its dating system
               for prizes in 1999/ 2000. The Foundation decided to name the prize for the year it
               was given rather than the year the work was produced, changing the pattern of the
               previous fifty years. This new system continues to the present. This means that in
               effect there are no prizes for the year 1999, but a year was not skipped in the granting
               of awards.</div>  </a>
