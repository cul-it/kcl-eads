            <div class="para">As the League's president from 1907 to 1922, Margaret Dreier Robins, the well-to-do
               daughter of a Brooklyn businessman, guided it through the period of its most active
               work. Among her close associates were several working class women who served as officers
               of the national or local Leagues, including Leonora O'Reilly of New York and Agnes
               Nestor and Mary Anderson of Chicago. After 1922, working women took over the leadership;
               Rose Schneiderman, a veteran leader of strikes in the needle trades, served as national
               president from 1926 to 1950.</div>  </a>

            <p></p>
            
            <div class="para">The Women's Trade Union League was founded in 1903 during the annual convention of
               the American Federation of Labor. Local branches were organized within a year in Boston,
               Chicago and New York. In 1907 its name became the National Women's Trade Union League
               of America. The League sought to counter the exploitation of working women by organizing
               them into trade unions and by securing protective legislation regulating their hours
               and working conditions and setting minimum wage standards. Its dual membership of
               working and middle class women made the League unique among social reform organizations
               of its day.</div>  </a>
         
         <hr><a name="a3">
            
            
            <div class="para">The records of the National Women's Trade Union League of America (NWTUL) span the
               lifetime of the organization from the first meeting in Boston in 1903 to the last
               bulletin of its official organ, LIFE AND LABOR, announcing the termination of the
               League's national charter in 1950. The records consist of correspondence, memoranda,
               speeches, clippings, notes, printed matter, and miscellaneous other items. </div>
            <div class="para"> The NWTUL's administrative operations are well documented in the headquarters records.
               Its policies and activities are recorded in the minutes of the Executive Board meetings
               and in the correspondence. Most of the letters and memoranda are from the various
               national League secretaries, particularly Elisabeth Christman, who held the position
               from 1921 to 1950. There is, as well, correspondence from various members of both
               the national and local Leagues, especially from the New York, Boston, and Chicago
               branches. Many of the local League members also served as officers and/or Executive
               Board members of the national League and are represented in the headquarters records.
               Included in this group are Margaret Dreier Robins, Mary Morton Kehew, Jane Addams,
               Rose Schneiderman, Mary Kenney O'Sullivan, Melinda Scott, Agnes Nestor, and Mary E.
               Dreier. Interspersed with the materials documenting the activities of the League are
               financial statements enumerating sources of income and costs of operation. </div>
            <div class="para"> The subject files as well as the headquarters records offer a major source of information
               concerning the League's goal of organizing women wage workers into trade unions. There
               is considerable material on the early history of the League in the historical data
               file. Many of the files on individual members contain biographical information, and
               the file on the American Federation of Labor sheds light on the League's relationship
               to that organization. Here and in the headquarters records is correspondence with
               Samuel Gompers, Frank Morrison, Frank Duffy, and Florence C. Thorne. </div>
            <div class="para"> Both series (headquarters records and subject files) contain documentation of the
               League's efforts to improve women's working conditions through supporting strikes,
               particularly in the garment industry, through the use of a training school to develop
               leadership among women of the working class, and through lobbying for the enactment
               of protective labor legislation. Issues such as the eight-hour day, a minimum wage,
               and the establishment of sanitary work areas were the focus of the League's early
               days. However, its interests broadened in later years to include federal aid to education,
               civil rights, price control, and social security. Correspondents include Ethel M.
               Smith, Eleanor Roosevelt, Sophonisba P. Breckinridge, Mary Anderson, Alice Henry,
               and Frances Perkins. </div>
            <div class="para"> The records of the NWTUL also contain proceedings for 10 of the 13 national conventions
               and mimeographed corrected copies of the proceedings of the three international congresses
               which the League sponsored.</div>  </a>
