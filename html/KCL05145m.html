            <div class="para">Karl Heinrich Marx (5 May 1818 – 14 March 1883) was a German philosopher, economist,
               historian, sociologist, political theorist, journalist and socialist revolutionary.
               Born in Trier, Germany, Marx studied law and philosophy at university. He married
               Jenny von Westphalen in 1843. Due to his political publications, Marx became stateless
               and lived in exile with his wife and children in London for decades, where he continued
               to develop his thought in collaboration with German thinker Friedrich Engels and publish
               his writings, researching in the reading room of the British Museum. His best-known
               titles are the 1848 pamphlet The Communist Manifesto and the three-volume Das Kapital
               (1867–1883). His political and philosophical thought had enormous influence on subsequent
               intellectual, economic and political history, and his name has been used as an adjective,
               a noun and a school of social theory.</div>
            <div class="para">Marx's critical theories about society, economics and politics – collectively understood
               as Marxism – hold that human societies develop through class conflict. In capitalism,
               this manifests itself in the conflict between the ruling classes (known as the bourgeoisie)
               that control the means of production and the working classes (known as the proletariat)
               that enable these means by selling their labour power in return for wages. Employing
               a critical approach known as historical materialism, Marx predicted that, like previous
               socio-economic systems, capitalism produced internal tensions that would lead to its
               self-destruction and replacement by a new system known as socialism.
               For Marx, class antagonisms under capitalism, owing in part to its instability and
               crisis-prone nature, would eventuate the working class' development of class consciousness,
               leading to their conquest of political power and eventually the establishment of a
               classless, communist society constituted by a free association of producers. Marx
               actively pressed for its implementation, arguing that the working class should carry
               out organised revolutionary action to topple capitalism and bring about socio-economic
               emancipation. 
               Marx has been described as one of the most influential figures in human history, and
               his work has been both lauded and criticised. His work in economics laid the basis
               for much of the current understanding of labour and its relation to capital, and subsequent
               economic thought. Many intellectuals, labour unions, artists and political parties
               worldwide have been influenced by Marx's work, with many modifying or adapting his
               ideas. Marx is typically cited as one of the principal architects of modern social
               science.</div>  </a>
