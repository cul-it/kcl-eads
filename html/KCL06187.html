            <div class="para">The Brotherhood of Railway and Steamship Clerks, Freight Handlers, Express, and Station
               Employees [BRAC] was founded in 1899 by 33 railroad clerks meeting in Sedalia, Missouri.
               They initially called the organizations "Order of Railroad Clerks of America," but
               renamed itself the "Brotherhood of Railway Clerks" to be in line with the nomenclature
               of the other railway labor organizations. Under that name, BRAC took part in the Illinois
               Central Shopmen's Strike of 1911. In 1919, the union once again changed its name and
               became the "Brotherhood of Railway and Steamship Clerks, Freight Handlers, Express
               and Station Employes" to better represent its growing membership. </div>
            <div class="para"> The name was expanded again in 1967 when Convention delegates added the word "Airline,"
               making the new organizational name "Brotherhood of Railway, Airline, Steamship Clerks,
               Freight Handlers, Express and Station Employes." The union was still referred to familiarly
               as BRAC. </div>
            <div class="para"> Finally, in 1987, after absorbing members from a half dozen other unions that merged
               with BRAC, the organization adopted its current name, the Transportation Communications
               International Union [TCU]. TCU merged with the International Association of Machinists
               and Aerospace Workers in mid-2005, and as of 2017 TCU/IAM represents approximately
               46,000 members who primarily work in the railroad industry. </div>
            <div class="para"> BRAC was the largest single railroad organization for employees who devoted a majority
               of their time to clerical work of any description. This included: chief clerks; foremen;
               train announcers; gatemen; checkers; parcel, baggage, and storeroom employees; dock
               and pier workers; train and engine crew callers; timekeepers; paymasters; freight
               inspectors; rate and tariff compilers; weigh masters; ticket clerks and sellers; operators
               of all office and station equipment devices; telephone and switchboard operators;
               and all employees occupying or performing duties similar to those mentioned. After
               three months of experience in clerical work, employees of both genders became eligible
               for membership. The union secured increases in wages and better working conditions
               for its members. </div>

            <div class="para"> This collection consists of the files of local chairman and president of Local 390,
               BRAC, for employees of the Reading Company, Philadelphia Division. </div>
            <div class="para"> The records in this collection consist primarily of personnel files: both disciplinary
               files where employees were found to be in violation of the collective bargaining agreements,
               and processed claims where employee grievances were redressed by the company. Also
               found in this collection are vacation agreements between BRAC and Reading, and employee
               requests for time off. Finally, this collection contains seniority rosters for various
               classes of employees, containing the names of people employed in various positions
               represented by BRAC. </div>
            <div class="para"> Of particular interest in this collection are the files relating to the implementation
               of automated processes into the workplace. The Reading Company purchased and installed
               IBM 1050 TRACE (Teleprompting Random Access Communication Exchange) machines. This
               resulted in changes to the workplace, both in that employees needed to be trained
               on how to use the new machines in their daily work and in changes to job titles and
               responsibilities, all of which had to be negotiated between the Reading Company and
               BRAC representatives. Additionally, discipline proceedings were initiated against
               employees who made mistakes when transmitting data via the TRACE punch cards on the
               IBM computers.</div>  </a>
