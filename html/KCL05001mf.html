            <div class="para">The American Association for Labor Legislation was formed to promote uniformity of
               labor legislation and to encourage the study of labor conditions with a view toward
               promoting desirable legislation. </div>
            <div class="para"> The Association was founded as a branch of the International Association for Labor
               Legislation. Preliminary discussions about forming the group occurred during 1905
               and culminated in the first meeting of the Association held on February 15, 1906,
               in New York City. </div>
            <div class="para"> During the Association's first few years, three basic objectives were established:
               to serve as the American branch of the International Association for Labor Legislation;
               to promote uniformity of labor legislation in the United States; and to encourage
               the study of labor conditions with a view toward promoting desirable labor legislation.
               </div>
            <div class="para"> John Bertram Andrews was appointed executive secretary in 1909. His wife, Irene Osgood
               Andrews, eventually became associate secretary. John Andrews, as lobbyist, lecturer,
               author and editor of the publication THE AMERICAN LABOR LEGISLATION REVIEW, became
               the motivating force of the Association. Broadly speaking, the American Association
               for Labor Legislation set the following goals: the alleviation of adverse working
               conditions; the creation of laws to protect safety and health on the job; and the
               provision of compensation in times of unemployment and benefits for workers no longer
               able to participate in the labor force. To facilitate the implementation of the Association's
               interests, study groups were established to investigate labor conditions. Active lobbying
               was undertaken in support of protective labor legislation in state and federal legislatures,
               and critiques were published concerning pending bills. The lifetime of the Association
               roughly corresponded to Andrew's lifetime; its activities ceased after his death in
               1943.</div>  </a>

                        in the International Association for Labor Legislation (IALL) inspired the establishment
                        of its American counterpart. A circular and an invitation to attend the general meeting
                        to organize the American section of the IALL on Feb. 15, 1906, drew favorable response
                        from several persons who would later be influential in the Association, notably Samuel
                        Gompers and Miles Mehander Dawson. The formal founding of the AALL dates from that
                        1906 meeting, and subsequent correspondence deals with the leadership and personnel
                        problems of the infant association, as well as with the relationship of the new organization
                        to the IALL. Richard T. Ely, first president of the AALL, wrote to Weber (2/26/07)
                        commenting that the AALL needed a paid representative to give his full time to the
                        work. The perennial problem of fund raising became a theme early in the organization's
                        correspondence. During 1908, the course that the AALL was to follow for the next few
                        years was developed. John R. Commons, then secretary, wrote to Dr. Henry B. Favill
                        of the American Medical Association expressing a desire to meet with him and Dr. Alice
                        Hamilton to discuss the investigation of occupational health and disease (1/21/08).
                        This dialogue accelerated the development of a standard nomenclature for occupational
                        disease and a proposal to investigate and recommend standards for industrial hygiene.
                        Newly appointed Assistant Secretary Irene Osgood exchanged letters with Margaret D.
                        Robins. Their correspondence concerned the Association's desire to investigate industrial
                        diseases and poisons, and the plans for establishment of state chapters. Support for
                        the organization was sought and won from socially conscious national leaders, including
                        Louis Brandeis, Edward T. Devine, Samuel Gompers, and Alice Hamilton. The assistance
                        of reform-minded groups such as the National Child Labor Committee was also successfully
                        solicited. Early in 1909, Commons and Osgood suggested to Henry W. Farnam that John
                        Andrews would make an excellent executive secretary. There was some question at this
                        juncture as to whether the official stationery of the Association should carry the
                        union label. Arguments on this issue went on for several years and are symptomatic
                        of the organization's ambivalent attitude toward organized labor. Dr. Alice Hamilton
                        continued her work with the AALL on industrial poisons and her letter to Osgood (2/13/09)
                        suggested that a study of the match industry be undertaken because of its widespread
                        use of poisonous white phosphorous.</div>

                     <div class="para">The investigation into phosphorous poisoning continued and developed into the "Phossy
                        Jaw" study. Interest arose in the Association in workmen's compensation and the Illinois
                        10-Hour Law, and John Andrews became the paid executive of the organization at about
                        this time. Louis Brandeis wrote to Arthur Kellogg (5/26/09) about the pension bill
                        of the Boston and Maine Railroad. The letter is significant for its early discussion
                        of certain provisions which eventually were adopted into the American old age pension
                        system. Correspondence during this period relates: to changes in legislation in regard
                        to job hazards, insurance, employment office regulations, and child labor. The organization
                        cooperated extensively with Brandeis and Josephine Goldmark in the preparation of
                        material with which to fight defeat of the Illinois 10-Hour Law. Louis Brandeis expressed
                        his gratitude to Andrews (11/30/09) for the information Andrews gathered for Brandeis'
                        work on the 10-Hour case brief. John R. Commons wrote Henry W. Farnam (12/25/09),
                        suggesting that the Association would do better to concern itself with active lobbying
                        for measures it supported rather than with organizing. Since the state branches of
                        the Association were not proving satisfactory. Commons thought that they should be
                        discontinued. Early in 1910 the executive office was transferred to New York City
                        where it remained for the life of the Association. In February John Andrews began
                        to collect information on a contributory workmen's compensation insurance plan; and
                        the Association continued to refine this plan for the next thirty years.</div>

                     <div class="para">The emergence of sickness insurance (health insurance) as a major concern of the AALL
                        dominates this period. Joseph Chamberlain outlined a suggested survey of European
                        sickness insurance (1/7/14) to be made prior to the AALL's investigation of the situation
                        in the United States. Many meetings of the Association's sickness insurance committee
                        were held. I. M. Rubinow wrote often in reference to drafting a standard bill (a prototype
                        legislative bill on a specific issue) on sickness insurance. There was some controversy
                        over whether or not it should be compulsory, and P. Tecumseh Shermam resigned because
                        of the disagreement (1/9/14). An interesting letter (9/16/13) to Henry Seager and
                        Henry W. Farnam describes Andrews' visit to the Cripple Creek Mine, the mine owner's
                        blacklist, a meeting with "Mother" Jones, and the growing conservatism of the Western
                        Federation of Miners. Irene Osgood Andrews wrote the report on minimum wage legislation
                        in New York State. In December (12/24/13) Andrews wrote again to Gompers, asking for
                        an apology. Andrews became interested in another problem of working conditions and
                        wrote often to Thomas J. Parkinson of the Columbia University Legislative Drafting
                        Department and others in regard to revision of the compressed air provisions of the
                        New York State labor laws.</div>

                        John Kern, providing workmen's compensation for federal employees in the District
                        of Columbia. Royal Meeker and I. M. Rubinow were in partial disagreement as to certain
                        sections of the bill and frequently wrote to Andrews about it. Throughout January
                        and February, plans were made for the National Conference on Unemployment that was
                        to be held in New York City (2/27/28). In addition, the growing problem of unemployment
                        sparked many surveys and reports. The meetings of the Sickness Insurance Committee
                        continued. Andrews defended the AALL's impartiality on "unionism" to James Emery (2/26/14)
                        and disclaimed any interest in labor-management disputes beyond the questions of health
                        and safety. Mid-March saw John and Irene Andrews working together on a survey of free
                        employment bureaus, and for the passage of a free employment agency bill in the New
                        York State Legislature. In June, Andrews began to prepare for the European Congresses
                        of the IALL by writing reports on United States labor legislation, unemployment, social
                        insurance and industrial disease.</div>

                     <div class="para">The commencement of World War I affected the Association drastically, The IALL congresses
                        were cancelled and funds that had been available to further the work of the AALL were
                        diverted to war relief. But sickness insurance and unemployment were still major issues.
                        Frederick Hoffman, who had been active on the Sickness Insurance Committee of the
                        AALL reported himself upset over the principle of compulsory insurance. Katherine
                        Coman suggested (8/13/14) that the committee stress prevention as well as relief,
                        a change that was soon made. Many requests for help in drafting workmen's compensation
                        laws were received from all over the United States during this period. Andrews was
                        busy on a study of occupational anthrax in the United States. In the fall, a study
                        of the effect of lead poisoning on workers was begun, using the Brooklyn Bridge painters
                        as a test group. Walter Lippmann interviewed Andrews on the unemployment problem in
                        October for a special issue of the New Republic. John R. Commons and Andrews consulted
                        frequently on their book, Principles of Labor Legislation.</div>

                        with this bill. At the end of May, Samuel Gompers resigned as Associate Vice President.
                        There is commentary on this event from several people, including an undated letter
                        (circa June) from Milton Fairchild to Henry Seager, in which he reports that: "Gompers
                        says he has changed the name of the Association to the Ameri-can Association for the
                        Assassination of Labor Legislation." John Andrews' letter to James Maurer (7/12/15)
                        is an excellent example of the strategy employed by the Association in exploiting
                        emo-tions to explain the need for their legislation. This letter deals with the death
                        of two "sand hogs" who were buried alive in an accident that "...could not have occurred
                        if our bill for the protection of compressed air workers had been in force in Pennsylvania."
                        On August 9, a series of letters and a questionnaire on relief of unemployment through
                        public work was sent out. Replies were received for the next several months.</div>

                     <div class="para">John Andrews sent Samuel McCune Lindsay the tentative program for 1916 (1/7/16), providing
                        an excellent synopsis of the year's work. The program on social insurance was to stress
                        workmen's compensation, health insurance and unemployment insurance. Accident and
                        disease reporting, support for the federal bill for a Museum of Safety, and the urging
                        of passage of the standard bill for compressed air workers and a cleanliness bill
                        for lead workers were to dominate the industrial safety and hygiene phase of the Association's
                        work. To meet the abuses of the so-called continuous industries, a one-day-rest-in-seven
                        bill was advocated, as was the three-shift system. Finally, the Association was to
                        urge reorganization of state labor bureaus, especially in Kentucky, Maryland, and
                        New Jersey, as a means of making the administration of existent labor legislation
                        more effective. The health insurance standard bill was introduced in Albany and Boston.
                        John Randolph Haynes approached Andrews (1/29/16) and volunteered a substantial contribution
                        if the AALL would make coal mine safety the first priority of its program. Through
                        May, Royal Meeker, Middleton Beaman, and others worked with the Association in urging
                        passage of the Kern-McGillicuddy Bill (workmen's compensation for District of Columbia).
                        In April, Andrews testified before the United States House of Representatives Committee
                        on Labor in favor of the establishment of a Commission for Investigating Social Insurance.
                        Frederick Hoffman resigned from the Association in a letter to Irving Fisher, in protest
                        against the AALL's insistence upon compulsory health insurance.</div>

                        to raise funds for its promotion with the slogan, "Health First." The Association
                        supported legislative bills for health insurance in New York and Michigan. On the
                        federal level, the AALL's most important piece of legislation was the Kern-McGillicuddy
                        Bill. In May, John Andrews sent AALL staffer Irene Sylvester to Washington to act
                        as the Association's lobbyist. Her informal letters to the New York office, reporting
                        on the progress of the bill, give examples of how one congressman put pressure on
                        another to insure his vote. In June, when she complained of discouragement, Andrews
                        wrote to her, "Cheer Up! Morbid depression is an occupational disease among those
                        who are obliged to be pleasant to Congressmen." (6/5/17) In late August, Andrews was
                        able to inform the AALL members that the bill had passed the Senate and that "...we
                        can now concentrate even greater effort on our campaign for universal health insurance."
                        Paul H. Douglas advised Andrews that since war seemed inevitable, the Association
                        should adopt a policy of guarding against exploitation of workers in time of war (4/1/17)
                        .. John Andrews initiated a special series of bulletins, Labor Laws in War Time. Communication
                        with the IALL offices in Europe became virtually impossible.</div>

                     <div class="para">Under the pressure of the war effort, demands for health insurance were de-emphasized,
                        while problems created by the emergency came to the fore. The United States Department
                        of Labor War Policies Board sent Andrews policy memoranda for review in late August.
                        In December of 1916, Andrews advised Senator Joseph Robinson (12/6/17) that the legislation
                        providing for federal public employment offices which he was to introduce should be
                        pushed as a war emergency measure. This is referred to as the Robinson-Keating Bill
                        in later letters., Gompers, largely out of touch with the Association, telegraphed
                        an invitation to Andrews to attend the American Federation of Labor Employment Problems
                        Conference. A form letter to members (12/19/17) outlined the program for 1918, which
                        included war emergency measures, Federal Public Employment Ser-vice, health insurance,
                        and labor adjustment. In mid-January 1918, Charles Barnes, Irving Fisher, Royal Meeker,
                        V. Everitt Macy and Edward Keating all wrote to Andrews, urging him to take the lead
                        in the fight for the Robinson- Keating Bill. Irene Osgood Andrews became very much
                        involved in efforts to organize the Maternity Center in New York City. Many state
                        federations of labor wrote for advice on health insurance, and in the fall, the AALL
                        worked for workmen's compensation in Maine, Arkansas and North Dakota.</div>

                     <div class="para">A letter from Andrews to New York State senators (12/18/18) set forth the Association's
                        objectives for 1919, including an amendment of workmen's compensation legislation
                        to exclude profit-making insurance companies, universal workingman's health insurance,
                        and a minimum wage for women. In early January, Henry Sterling sent a copy of the
                        workmen's compensation act which he had prepared for the American Federation of Labor
                        to Andrews for his criticism. Letters were received from IALL staff members Sophy
                        Sanger and Stephen Bauer, trying to re-establish communications. Frances Perkins,
                        Commissioner of the New York State Industrial Commission, wrote to ask for information
                        on maternity insurance, and later wrote to Irene Andrews for John's views on health
                        insurance. Irene Sylvester, now Mrs. Walston Chubb, was sent by the Associa-tion to
                        Albany to lobby for the Donahue-Davenport health insurance bill. In March 1919, a
                        new standard bill for workmen's compensation was issued , based on that of the state
                        of Ohio and on federal legis-lation. Irene Andrews wrote Sophy Sanger (4/2/19) that
                        she expected to be in London in April to tour maternity centers, and that John would
                        be in London later that summer.</div>

                        for the educational commission of the United States War Department. The trip also
                        provided the opportunity for him to serve as technical advisor to the organizing committee
                        appointed by the federal government to set up the International Labor Legislation
                        Conference scheduled for October in Washington. On his return in September, Andrews
                        sent John R. Commons a report of his trip, and stated that he expected to spend most
                        of his time that fall in Washington. S. S. Goldwater and Alexander Lambert of the

                        League for Americanism, and the Association's attention focused on combating this
                        opposition. Dr. Alexander Lambert, President of the AMA, wrote John Andrews (1/28/20),
                        "I think that my profession will get over its present state of hysteria (over health
                        insurance) just as my ancestors got over the Salem witchcraft." The federal employee

                        the spring. I. M. Rubinow was in Palestine during this period, and his scattered letters

                        health insurance as the center of concern of the Association during this period, although
                        it was still fighting the charges of "un-Americanism" in regard to the latter. The
                        problem of workmen's compensation for longshoremen and seamen was studied, and there
                        was correspondence with union leaders, including Andrew Furuseth, and with T. V. O'Connor
                        on this subject. The Federal Employee Retirement Bill (Sterling-Lehblach) was passed
                        in late May. Many people wrote to congratulate Andrews on the Association's role in
                        securing its passage. Unemployment insurance was again an issue, and Andrews suggested
                        to J. J. Handley (9/24/20) that the Wisconsin State Federation of Labor try to sponsor
                        an unemployment insurance bill in its state.</div>

                        Miller a nine and one half page report from the Association on the need for an unemployment

                        cripples, and reasonable work hours. As the federal bill to provide workmen's compensation

                     <div class="para">In addition to the programs planned for 1923, a heavy emphasis on old age pensions
                        and insurance dominated the work of the Association. Columbia University Legislative
                        Drafting Bureau sent John Andrews (1/12/23) the program of the AALL for old age pensions
                        that had been worked out in cooperation with the Eagles. Abraham Epstein wrote often
                        during the early months of the year on the progress of the old age pension bill and
                        Gomper's attitude toward it. Epstein's personal dissatisfaction with his job is evidenced
                        in his April correspondence. Felix Frankfurter wrote to Andrews (6/18/23) in regard
                        to his def-inition of law enforcement. Herbert Hoover wrote in late August to invite
                        Andrews to serve as an informal observer at the International Unemployment Association
                        Conference in Luxembourg that fall. Sidney Hillman explained the workings of his union's
                        private unem-ployment insurance contract (9/26/23). During the summer months, special
                        efforts were made to fight discrimination in granting workmen's compensation awards
                        to the non-resident dependents of aliens.</div>

                     <div class="para">The Association continued to be concerned about industrial disease and accidents,
                        particularly those relating to radium poisoning and mine safety. Katherine Wiley wrote
                        Andrews about several girls who died after being employed to paint radium on watch
                        faces, and enclosed several letters which gave details of the case (6/19/24). Andrews
                        suggested to Ethelbert Steward (6/19/24) that the Bureau of Labor Statistics should
                        investigate the problem of phosphorous poison in the fireworks industry and the radium
                        poison cases. Correspondence with E. A. Holbrook, the American Mining Congress and
                        the Mining Standardization Coordinating Committee continued to emphasize coal dusting
                        and general mine safety. Henri Fuss wrote about the merger of the IALL and other international
                        associations with the International Association for Social Progress (IASP) (7/10/24).
                        Andrews asked Herbert Hoover if the government would be willing to pay his passage
                        to the IASP Congress, but Hoover replied (9/8/24) that, although he would like Andrews
                        to be the government's informal representative, there were no funds available to support
                        this trip. Ida Tarbell wrote John Andrews in 1925 that she expected to write a piece
                        on coal dusting: "This is not merely to save face with you but because I would like
                        to do something, even if so very little, to help push the matter."</div>

                        advocating old age pensions began in December, 1925. Worth M. Tippy of the Federal
                        Council of Churches requested John Andrews' assessment of Abraham Epstein and his
                        ideas after Tippy was approached to back Epstein's new national organiza-tion. The
                        program for 1926 was prepared in late November and included the fight for "real wages",
                        reduction of waste in industry, workmen's compensation, accident prevention, and unemployment
                        relief. The area of special interest in workmen's compensation during late 1925 and
                        early 1926 was the passage of legislation to protect interstate workers, especially
                        longshoremen and seamen. Anthony Chlopek of the longshoremen and Andrew Furuseth of
                        the seamen were the Association's chief union contacts. Throughout January and February,
                        several criticisms of the AALL's newest federal longshoremen's and interstate workers'
                        compensation bill were received? those from Charles Verrill (1/18/26), Frederick Wilcox

                     <div class="para">Correspondence of this period centers on the AALL's announcement (2/19/26) that its
                        federal compensation bill for longshoremen had been introduced in the House and would
                        be referred to as the Cummins-Graham Bill. William Green wrote (3/2/26) that the American
                        Federation of Labor had informed Anthony Chlopek that all possible support would be
                        given to this bill. Eleanor Roosevelt wrote (3/4/25) in response to an AALL form letter
                        to the membership on this question that she was writing to the Democratic members
                        of the House and Senate Judiciary Committee, urging support for the bill. Chlopek
                        informed John Andrews (5/1/26) that his efforts on behalf of the International Longshoremen's
                        Association (ILA) were much appreciated. Other areas of the Association's work were
                        not forgotten. In early February Andrews traveled to Washington to lobby for the passage
                        of the Fitzgerald Workmen's Compensation Bill and to consult with Congressman Fitzgerald.
                        In March he reported to J. R. Haynes his meetings with Herbert Hoover and Scott Turner
                        regarding his work on a mine safety bill. A New York Times editorial, dated May 8,
                        praising the AALL's advocacy of coal dusting for coal mine safety, was the basis for
                        yet another attempt by Andrews to raise funds for the Association.</div>

                     <div class="para">The progress of the Graham-Cummins bill was of continuing interest. Congressman Graham
                        gave John Andrews his version of the reason why the bill never was called out of committee
                        in the House, although it did pass the Senate. From August through December, Andrews
                        kept up a running correspondence with Charles Verrill and Anthony Chlopek on amendments
                        to the Graham-Cummins bill that might enable it to pass at the next session. In late
                        November Thomas Chadbourne made an unusual pledge to the Association, promising to
                        give $10,000 a year for the next three years if Andrews could raise $15,000. The money
                        was intended especially to wipe the "black spots" off the compensation map. (The AALL
                        Review periodically published a map showing workmen's compensation legislation's spread
                        by state. Those states without any compensation law at all were shown in solid black,
                        hence "black spots.") Andrews replied to this letter (12/2/26). Programs for 1927
                        included achieving workmen's compensation laws in those five states still without
                        them, workmen's compensation for longshoremen (Graham-Cummins), and mine safety. John
                        Andrews went frequently to Washington to organize support for the Graham-Cummins bill.
                        The legislation was finally passed on March 4, 1927. Throughout March, letters were
                        received regretting the effect of the American Association for Old Age Security (Epstein's
                        new organiza-tion, AAOAS) on the American Association for Labor Legislation. Most
                        officers of the new association were AALL members and many felt that they had been
                        misled by Epstein in regard to John Andrews' support for the AAOAS.</div>

                     <div class="para">Concerned over the problem of two national organizations dedicated to very similar
                        purposes, Paul H. Douglas and Ethelbert Talbot tried to arrange a merger of the AALL
                        and the AAOAS, After much correspondence, this effort was to result in failure. Andrews
                        was very busy trying to raise funds to match the Chadbourne pledge. He also began
                        an attack on the lack of workmen's compensation legislation in Florida with a series
                        of letters to local politicians and local AALL members. A blow to the Association's
                        mine safety campaign came when J. R. Haynes informed Andrews (8/2/27) that he would
                        have to discontinue his financial support of the AALL in order to concentrate on a
                        public ownership plan in Los Angeles. Andrews sought funding from the United Mine
                        Workers. A letter in the fall from John L. Lewis (10/14/27) in-formed the Association
                        that the request would go before the national executive board of the union. Work with
                        E. A. Holbrook on mine safety standards was carried on through September and October.</div>

                     <div class="para">The question of a merger with the AAOAS, the problems of administering workmen's compensation
                        for longshoremen, and the reintroduction of the bill to provide workmen's compensation
                        in the District of Columbia were the Association's priority concerns in those months.
                        Miles Dawson described to Andrews (11/22/27) Abraham Epstein's willingness to merge
                        if the AALL would finance the new organization. Andrews was not enthusiastic about
                        the suggestion, and in a letter to Frank Hering of the Eagles (1/4/28) detailed his
                        reasons for avoiding the merger. The conflict with the Epstein organization continued
                        to cause difficulties, as reflected in a letter from Florence Kelley (3/15/28) that
                        charged the AALL with a lack of depth.</div>

                     <div class="para">The passage of the Fitzgerald Bill providing workmen's compensation for private employees
                        in the District of Columbia was the highlight of the spring and summer. Merger of
                        the AALL and the AAOAS was still advocated by Paul Douglass and by I. M. Rubinow and
                        Stephen Wise, who were longtime advisers of Andrews. Before the Fitzgerald Bill was
                        enacted, Margaret Hobbs James had succeeded to the position of AALL lobbyist. Andrews
                        congratulated her on the bill's enactment (5/14/28) and the following day assigned
                        her to work on the Jones Bill for the vocational rehabilitation of industrial cripples.
                        The Ribnik vs. McBride decision of the Supreme Court upset the AALL's efforts to regulate
                        private fee-charging employment agencies. There is correspondence with Robert Wagner
                        which leads to his intro-duction in Congress of an AALL-drafted bill providing for
                        public em-ployment bureaus. Andrews wrote Sophy Sanger (7/18/28) that he would be
                        attending some of the international social workers conferences in Paris in July, and
                        hoped to spend some time after that in Britain gathering material on British labor
                        law administration. On his return in September, he wrote to Frank Hering of the Eagles,
                        proposing that they undertake a joint study of old age pension systems in New York
                        State.</div>

                     <div class="para">Workmen's compensation became an increasing concern of the Asso-ciation. John Andrews
                        queried Felix Frankfurter and others about the possibility of compensation for railroad
                        workers. Frankfurter's reply (10/30/28) did not favor a federal program, but suggested
                        individual state legislation. Andrews was always keenly interested in national politics
                        and supported Al Smith against Herbert Hoover. In November, after Smith's defeat,
                        he wrote Solon De Leon that he was terribly disappointed, "Our vaunted religious liberty
                        is but a bubble that has been pricked." Turning his attention to New York State, he
                        wrote the then Governor-elect, Franklin D. Roosevelt, suggesting that he include occupational
                        disease compensation and regulation of fee-charging private employment agencies in
                        his 1929 message to the legislature. Governor Roosevelt replied that he thought the
                        AALL's proposal of blanket coverage for occupational diseases was reasonable, and
                        that he did not anticipate much objection to the proposals. Andrews wrote to Felix
                        Frankfurter again, this time to inquire whether Frankfurter had written a minimum
                        wage bill that would meet the constitutional objections. Frankfurter replied (12/20/28)
                        that he felt that he and B. V. Cohen had, but that correspondence was too cumbersome
                        a medium for discussion; Mr. Cohen would come to confer with Mr. Andrews. The program
                        for 1929 was planned to include the social cost of accidents, sickness and old age
                        insurance, unemployment, labor law administration and workmen's compensation for the
                        new industrial South. A form letter (1/23/29) urged that members write in support
                        of the vocational rehabilitation bill, the Jones Property Reserve Bill and the Wagner
                        Bill (in earlier years known as the Kenyon-Nolan Bill) for adequate public employment
                        bureaus. Margaret James Hobbs wrote (2/4/29) that she was discouraged in her work
                        for the passage of the vocational rehabilitation bill, and expressed hope that Andrews
                        would come to Washington to organize support for it.</div>

                     <div class="para">The year 1929 was dominated by the Association's attempt to institute workmen's compensation
                        in the few southern states without it. The curtailment of contributions made the financial
                        conditions even more critical than usual. Andrews was hard-pressed to match the Chadbourne
                        pledge. The AALL's first mid-year annual meeting was organized in March. In May, and
                        throughout the year, Andrews corresponded with John R. Commons and others concerning
                        a very extensive study by the Association of labor law administration in the United
                        States. Later that month Frances Perkins appointed Andrews to the Governor's Commission
                        on Unemployment Problems in New York State. Andrews' attacks on a new appointee to
                        the United States Employees Compensation Commission upset Fiorello La Guardia, who
                        wrote to Andrews that the man in question "...may not have a college degree but he
                        does have a heart." (6/11/29) The Association's relationship with the International
                        Longshore-men's Association suffered when the new president, Joseph Ryan, was displeased
                        by Andrews' actions in the union's behalf (6/20/29). Congressman G. W. Norris wrote
                        Andrews (6/22/29) that Ryan informed him that the Longshoremen were not behind the
                        legislation that Andrews had requested Norris to introduce. William Doak wrote (7/5/29)
                        in regard to compensation for railroad workers that some of the men were too strongly
                        opposed to it for the union to favor such legislation. The Andrews' enjoyed a long
                        working trip across the country in the summer. During most of the fall, Andrews worked
                        on unemployment prob-lems. In a December letter, John Fitch (12/6/29) reported that
                        Labor News had suggested that the AALL be asked to draft a bill to create a federal
                        unemployment insurance system, and that if the Association did not do so, a new national
                        organization would be formed to push such legislation. In January John Andrews and
                        AALL staff member Cornelius Cochrane traveled in the South to generate support for
                        workmen's compensation legislation.</div>

                        and South Carolina, organizing support for workmen's compensation. Ida Tarbell requested
                        background information (1/28/30) for an article on vocational rehabilitation. The
                        Association's work in New York State was largely in the form of lobbying for control
                        of fee-charging employment agencies. Andrews was discouraged by the long fight against
                        such agencies and wrote Joseph Chamberlain (3/13/30) that if AALL could not get that
                        bill passed this year, it might just as well give it up. Fred Wilcox, Chairman of
                        the New York State Committee on Unemployment Problems, sent Andrews a copy of the
                        committee's report (3/25/30). Financial conditions continued to create severe constraint
                        on the Association's activity, and Thomas Chadbourne informed the Association (4/7/30)
                        that he would not be able to renew his annual gift of $10,000. A mid-year meeting
                        was held in conjunction with the National Con-ference of Social Work. The AALL's program
                        included workmen's compensation, social insurance, old age pensions and unemployment
                        remedies. April through June saw concentrated work on the unemployment relief bills
                        that Robert Wagner had introduced. Wagner informed Andrews (5/28/30) that these bills
                        should be passed before the Association's unemployment insurance bill was introduced.</div>

                     <div class="para">The Association continued to devote its work in November and December to the ever
                        increasing problems of unemployment, with a renewed interest in public works projects
                        to reduce the ranks of the jobless. John Andrews, John Fitch, Grace Coyle, Mary Drier,
                        Rose Schneiderman, and many others formed a committee to push unemployment insurance
                        in the New York State legislature under the auspices of the AALL. Governor Roosevelt
                        requested John Andrews' concrete proposals to fight unemployment (12/29/30). The new
                        year brought the involvement of even more people in the Association's plans for unemployment
                        insurance. Paul Raushenbush wrote from Wisconsin that he and Elizabeth Brandeis had
                        ideas about the unemployment problem and wished to cooperate with the AALL. His letter
                        (1/8/31) began many years of correspondence with Andrews on this subject, ending only
                        with Andrews' death. Under discussion was the Association's "American Plan for Unemployment
                        Insurance," a plan that featured no contribution to the fund on the part of the employees.
                        William Doak, newly appointed United States Secretary of Labor, accepted the vice-presidency
                        of the AALL on January 17, and a few weeks later (2/2/31) resigned because of the
                        Association's advocacy of the Wagner employment bills.</div>

                        unemployment relief and workmen's compensation for the southern states still without
                        it. Activities in New York State centered on the recently formed Conference for Unemployment
                        Insurance Legislation. John Fitch's letter from the conference to the parent AALL
                        (3/10/31) lists the officers of the conference. Roosevelt wrote to Andrews (3/19/31),
                        asking him to serve on a commission to solve the problem of inadequate medical aid
                        for compensation cases. Later, Andrews wrote Roosevelt, urging that he not sign the
                        bill authorizing private corporations to sell unemployment insurance. Andrews was
                        in Florida in May working for workmen's compensa-tion.</div>

                        and the need of the AALL for financial support recur throughout this period. A form
                        letter sent in early June (6/4/31) indicated that at the mid-year meeting which would
                        be held in Minneapolis, the chief topic was to be the prevention of unemployment.
                        In July a telegram to the AALL office from John Andrews (7/15/31) indicated that he
                        was working in North Carolina on workmen's compensation legislation. Later, Andrews
                        wrote Ernest Draper (8/31/31) that Cochrane was still working in the South, particularly
                        in South Carolina. The Executive Secretary's correspondence with John R. Commons (8/14/31)
                        and a letter from Paul Raushenbush discuss the AALL's sponsorship of an education

                        and Elizabeth Brandeis. In September (9/19/31) the program, called the Wisconsin Commission

                        insurance and reserves. The AALL backed the policy on the change in name of the New
                        York Conference for Unemployment Insurance Legislation to the New York Conference
                        for Unemployment Reserves Legislation (3/21/32). Andrews wrote Anna Bogue, secretary
                        to Mrs. Willard Straight Elmhurst, a heavy contributor, that he was attempting to
                        set up effective state commissions on unemployment reserve legislation in Michigan
                        and Pennsylvania (4/19/32). Robert F. Wagner congratulated Andrews (4/25/32) on the

                        gave on the unemployment exchange bill. Wagner also stated that he had appreciated

                        relief. Andrews wrote Paul Raushenbush (10/4/32) about the amount of time the AALL
                        had spent in working out a formula that would "save face" for gubernatorial candidate
                        Lehman and reverse his position on unemployment reserves. A letter to Ernest Draper
                        (11/10/32) deals with the National Committee on Unemployment Reserves, a satellite
                        of the AALL. The problem of how to invest unemployment reserve monies also received
                        wide attention. Mary E. Drier, Executive Secretary of the New York Conference on Unemployment
                        Reserves Legislation, wrote to Irene Osgood Andrews (1/2/33), reminding her that when
                        Lehman spoke on unemployment insurance, they must write and thank him for his leadership.

                        and interstate workers. The Association was in such need of funds and office space
                        that John Andrews offered (3/13/33) to sell the AALL collection of early literature
                        on workmen's compensation to John P. Troxell at Duke University. The American Association

                        Personality factors were prominent in disputes. In August Mary Drier wrote to warn
                        Andrews (8/7/33) that they must keep Abraham Epstein out of the New York State fight
                        for unemployment insurance. Dorothy Douglas resigned from the executive committee
                        (11/4/33) because she felt its attitude toward unemployment insurance had been equivocal.
                        Miles M. Dawson wrote Andrews (12/20/33) that he wished to cooperate with the AALL
                        because he had had a falling out with Epstein. The AALL program for 1934 included
                        sponsorship of legislation providing unemployment reserves, amendment of workmen's
                        compensation, and public employment offices. In February Edwin E. Witte wrote to Andrews
                        (2/9/34), advising him that unemployment insurance was winning support for Epstein
                        and the AASS. Wittee felt the AALL should move quickly as "the champion of the rights
                        of organized labor," to counter the swing.</div>

                        of unemployment reserves on insurance were vigorously debated. I. M. Rubinow wrote
                        John Andrews (4/13/34) in regard to unemployment insurance, and also said that he
                        hoped they could affect a reconciliation. Andrews discussed budget problems in his
                        correspondence with Eustace Seligman (4/18/34), AALL treasurer. The budget had been
                        $72,000 in 1930. By 1933, it was down to $37,000 with a deficit of about $1,000. The
                        lack of funds seriously curtailed the Associations work. Isador Lubin informed Andrews
                        (5/22/34) about the President's quandry on the Wagner-Lewis bill and the President's
                        plan to appoint a "royal commission" to report on needed social legislation. Edwin
                        E. Witte wrote Andrews (6/19/34) that he found President Roosevelt's message on social

                        social insurance, Leo Wolman replied (6/26/34) that he would do anything he could

                     <div class="para">The new United States Commission on Economic Security involved several active AALL
                        members. Edwin E. Witte (8/1/34) and Arthur J. Altmeyer (8/17/34) wrote of their work
                        and sought advice from Andrews. Frances Perkins, as chairman of the Commission, invited
                        Andrews (10/30/34) to the White House Conference on Economic Security. In November
                        (11/17/34), Andrews applied to the John and Mary Markle Foundation for a grant to
                        cover the study of the extension of workmen's compensation to interstate commerce
                        employees. A form letter sent out by the AALL (12/7/34) asked persons interested in
                        seeing health insurance included in the new social insurance program to contact Frances
                        Perkins immediately. Correspondence early in 1935 with the Railway Labor Executives

                        the bill drafted by Andrews and the AALL extending unemployment insurance to employees
                        working in interstate commerce. Edwin E. Witte wrote (1/23/35) suggesting that Andrews
                        testify for the economic security bill at the hearing.</div>

                        for this period. Edwin E. Witte thanked Andrews for his help with the economic security
                        bill (2/23/35) but was worried that it would not be released from the House Ways and
                        Means Committee. Witte asked if the AALL could stimulate some pressure. Andrews sent
                        out an appropriate letter to the membership (2/25/35). Correspondence with members
                        in southern states and with the general AALL membership concerning workmen's compensation
                        continued. Andrews informed Paul Raushenbush (5/17/35) that Florida, South Carolina
                        and North Carolina had all adopted workmen's compensation legislation in the first
                        two weeks of May. The interstate commerce bill, as Andrews wrote to Senator Wagner
                        (5/15/35), was in the process of being amended by an AALL committee. A long letter
                        (8/11/35) gave Andrews Edwin E. Witte's reactions to the final passage of the Social
                        Security Act, his own feelings toward it, toward Andrews and toward the work done
                        by the AALL.</div>

                     <div class="para">The launching of Social Security provoked much discussion. Edwin E. Witte reported
                        (11/5/35) and Andrews "will certainly be considered," according to Altmeyer and Winant,
                        for the Geneva appointment. (This probably refers to the position of American representative
                        to the International Labor Office). Frances Perkins wrote to Andrews (1/3/36) to comment
                        on his latest book, Administration of Labor Legislation. Edwin E. Witte wrote (1/25/36)
                        that he felt that Abraham Epstein was trying to get credit for himself for the passage
                        of the Social Security Sill and deny credit to President Roosevelt. The new year brought
                        renewed interest in industrial safety. Walter Gellhorn, Frances Perkins, and several
                        others corresponded with Andrews in February about problems concerning occupational
                        disease, particularly silicosis and tuberculosis.</div>

                     <div class="para">In the spring a letter was sent out by the AALL (4/14/36), which was opposed to depriving
                        silicosis victims of compensation. Andrews spent the summer in Europe, and in the
                        fall tried to encourage new programs for the AALL. Isador Lubin invited Andrews (4/23/36)
                        to be an adviser to the American delegation at the conference of the International
                        Labor Office (ILO) in Geneva. Irene Andrews wrote Ethel Johnson, the ILO Washington
                        representative (7/8/36), that after the Geneva meeting, John would be going back to
                        England to complete his study of British factory inspection and labor law administration.
                        When Andrews returned to New York, he reported to Edwin E. Witte (8/25/36) on the
                        Geneva conference and the possibility of his spending another three months there in
                        the fall. Andrews had been named a special agent to the United States Department of
                        Labor and was asked to write a report on the results of his British factory inspection
                        study. Andrews wrote Elizabeth Brandeis (10/5/36) that things were so difficult financially
                        for the AALL that neither he nor Irene had drawn a salary for the last six months.
                        Frances Perkins suggested to Andrews (11/24/36) that his proposed study of financing
                        labor law administration be made under the sponsorship of the United States Bureau

                        of Unemployment Compensation of the Social Security Board. During this period he sent
                        out a form letter (3/8/37), seeking financial support for a study of the problem of
                        silicosis and ventilation in state mine inspection. Fiorello LaGuardia invited Andrews
                        (4/20/37) to join the panel of arbitrators of the New York City Industrial Relations
                        Board. Andrews went to Europe in the summer. He wrote Professor Brainard that he would
                        be attending the ILO conference and working at the ILO office in Geneva during June
                        and July. On his return to the United States, he continued to work to raise mine safety
                        standards. A letter from D. Harrington, Chief of the Health and Safety Branch of the
                        United States Bureau of Mines (9/7/37), commented on changes Andrews suggested in

                        studies, such as those in the area of labor law administration, were undertaken. Andrews
                        wrote E. W. Bakke (1/3/38) about the AALL study of municipal labor legislation. The
                        budget reached a new low of $25,000. Andrews suggested (1/29/38) to the treasurer,
                        Eustace Seligman, that a special effort be made to secure funds for mine safety, physical
                        examinations for workers, and the ratification of the ILO maritime conventions. John
                        Andrews sent John Winant at the ILO, Geneva (5/6/38), parts of the report on labor
                        inspection in the United States. Andrews returned to Geneva that summer. Andrews and
                        Walter Gellhorn corresponded through October and December on the "...baby Wagner Act"
                        and the Walsh-Healy Bill that the AALL was setting up for the Rhode Island Federation
                        of Labor. Andrews sent the Walsh-Healy Bill to the Rhode Island Federation of Labor
                        (12/22/38). During the first three months of 1939, amendments to the interstate workmen's
                        compensation bill were prepared. Andrews sent Robert Wagner (1/22/39) amendments to
                        the interstate workmen's bill which he hoped Wagner would approve and reintroduce.
                        Frances Perkins replied (1/27/39) to Andrews' note in regard to the Harry Bridges
                        case: "It helps a great deal to hear from one's . . ." John A. Kratz (2/24/39) gave
                        Andrews credit for the original passage of the Vocational Rehabilitation Act and thanked
                        Andrews for his suggestions. Andrews also wrote to Harold Ickes (2/25/39) and (3/1/39),

                        contacted Andrews about the disaster at the Duvin mine near Providence, Kentucky.
                        Edwin E. Witte wrote Andrews (8/29/39) and Andrews replied (9/18/39) about revisions
                        that Arthur J. Altmeyer forced Witte to make in an article. Andrews thought the changes
                        were ridiculous. John L. Lewis complimented Andrews (2/10/40) on the letter the AALL
                        distributed on the need for mine safety legislation, and asked Andrews to remove his
                        name from the Association letterhead, as his policy did not permit his name to be

                        to all interstate employees. This was largely the AALL's program for 1941. Harold
                        Ickes, Secretary of the Interior, wrote to Andrews (2/25/41) about federal mine inspection.
                        The AALL sent a form letter (3/25/41) to the state departments of labor, asking about
                        the failure of employers to insure their employees. In April, Andrews wrote to Merritt
                        L. Gordon (4/14/41), relating the early years of the AALL. Andrews stated that he
                        had attended the first organizational meeting in December 1905. Arthur J. Altmeyer
                        wrote about the need for physical examinations for workers (5/8/41). Andrews outlined
                        the new aims of the AALL in a letter to Professor H. Pillsbury Styles (5/8/41). He
                        stressed federal health and disability insurance and the adoption of the federal mine
                        inspection bill.</div>

                     <div class="para">Andrews wrote Morris Leeds and others (1/15/42) of his interest in regularizing the
                        textile industry and stopping its practice of running three shifts for some weeks
                        and then shutting down in others, The threat of the second world war was felt. Andrews
                        cautioned the membership "to be watchful lest (by) their short-sighted good intention
                        many of our labor laws be broken down" (2/1/42). Andrews complained to C. Edwin Gilmore
                        (2/2/42) that "We are in a tidal sweep of federalization in the field of labor legislation."
                        Plans for the annual meeting were discussed with Professor C. Clively in October (10/8/42),
                        which suggested a joint meeting with the Rural Sociological Society on Mexican workers
                        in the United States and the general need for extending social security protection
                        to farm workers. One of Andrews' last letters in the collection, written shortly before
                        his death, is to Barbara Peterson of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, explaining
                        that for the first time the AALL's annual meeting would be cancelled ". . .on account
                        of wartime conditions."</div>
