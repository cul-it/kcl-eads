            <div class="para">In the latter part of 1951, a dispute arose between the steel companies and their
               employees over terms and conditions that should be included in new collective bargaining
               agreements. Long-continued conferences failed to resolve the dispute. On December
               l8, 1951, the employees' representative United Steelworkers of America, CIO, gave
               notice of an intention to strike "when the existing bargaining agreements expired
               on December 31. Thereupon the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service intervened
               in an effort to get labor and management to agree. This failing, the President on
               December 22, 1951 referred the dispute to the Federal Wage Stabilization Board to
               investigate and make recommendations for fair and equitable terms of settlement. This
               Board's report resulted in no settlement. On April 4, 1952, the union gave notice
               of a nation-wide strike called to begin at 12:01 a.m. April 9. </div>
            <div class="para"> The indispensability of steel as a component of substantially all weapons and other
               war materials led the President to believe that the proposed work stoppage would immediately
               jeopardize our national defense and that governmental seizure of the steel mills was
               necessary in order to assure the continued availability of steel. Reciting these considerations
               for his action, the President, a few hours before the strike was to begin, issued
               Executive Order 10340. The order directed the Secretary of Commerce to take possession
               of and operate most of the steel mills throughout the country. The Secretary immediately
               issued his own possessory orders, calling upon the presidents of the various seized
               companies to serve as operating managers for the United States. They were directed
               to carry on their activities in accordance with regulations and directions of the
               Secretary. The next morning the President sent a message to Congress reporting his
               action. Cong. Rec. April 9, 1952 p. 3962. Twelve days later he sent a second message.
               Cong. Rec, April 21, 1952, p. 4192. Congress has taken no action. </div>
            <div class="para"> Obeying the Secretary's orders under protest, the companies brought proceedings against
               him in the District Court. Their complaints charged that the seizure was not authorized
               by an act of Congress or by any constitutional provisions. The District Court was
               asked to declare the orders of the President and the Secretary invalid and to issue
               preliminary and permanent injunctions restraining their enforcement. Opposing the
               motion for preliminary injunction, the United States asserted that a strike disrupting
               steel production for even a brief period would so endanger the well-being and safety
               of the nation that the President has "inherent power" to do what he had done power
               "supported by the Constitution, by historical precedent, and by court decisions. </div>
            <div class="para"> The Government also contended that in any event no preliminary injunction should
               be issued because the companies had made no showing that their available legal remedies
               were inadequate or that their injuries from seizure would be irreparable. Holding
               against the Government on all points, the District Court on April 30 issued a preliminary
               injunction restraining the Secretary from "continuing the seizure and possession of
               the plant... and from acting under the purported authority of Executive Order No.10340."
               103 F. Supp. 569. On the same day the Court of Appeals stayed the District Court's
               injunction. </div>
            <div class="para"> Since the issues raised, 1. Should the final determination of the constitutional
               validity of the President's order be made in a case which had reached only the preliminary
               injunction stage in the lower courts, and was the secure order within the constitutional
               power of the president were constitutional questions which it seemed best to decide
               promptly. The Supreme Court granted certiorari on May 3 and rendered its decision
               on June 2, 1952. By a 6 to 3 ruling they held that the President has no authority
               under the Constitution to seize private property of industry by executive order on
               the grounds that a work stoppage is imminent as a result of a labor dispute and that
               continued operation of the industry's facilities is necessary because of a national
               emergency.</div>  </a>
