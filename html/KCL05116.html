               arbitrator and mediator. In this field he served on numerous state and federal boards
               and in various governmental agencies. Cole was chairman of the New Jersey State Board

               (1948-1958); the chairman of the conciliation service for the New York City transit
               service (1961-1965); director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (1952-1953);

               member of the President's Labor- Management Advisory Committee (1961-1964); and member
               of the New York Governor's Public Employee Relations Committee (1966-1968), which
               established the New York State Public Employee Relations Board. Cole was also appointed
               as chairman of the President's Commission on Industrial Peace in 1973. </div>
            <div class="para"> Beyond his public service, Mr. Cole was active as a counsel for employer groups in
               the textile industry (1926-1942) and as an impartial chairman for other labor-management

               Plan (1954-1976), served as a visiting professor at the New York State School of Industrial
               and Labor Relations at Cornell University (1954-1955) and was Kestenbaum lecturer
