            <div class="para">First established in 1918 as the Woman in Industry Service, the Women's Bureau was
               made a permanent part of the Department of Labor by act of Congress in 1920. The Bureau
               was mandated "to formulate standards and policies which promote the welfare of wage-earning
               women, improve their working conditions, increase their efficiency, and advance their
               opportunities for profitable employment ...[with] authority to investigate and report
               to the said [Labor] Department on all matters pertaining to the welfare of women in
               industry."</div>  </a>
         
         <hr><a name="a3">
            
            
            <div class="para">Part 1 of the Bureau's records consist of four series summarizing its work from the
               time of its predecessor, the Woman in Industry Service, to the mid 1960's and providing
               regular summaries of the Bureau's activities and policy positions. These are: Monthly
               reports (1918-1948); Annual summaries (1922-1932); Conferences of the Women's Bureau
               (1918-1965); and speeches and articles prepared by Women's Bureau officers (1918-1958).
               </div>
            <div class="para"> Monthly reports of the director of the Women's Bureau (1918-1948) begin with the
               Woman in Industry Service. Reports were submitted to the Secretary of Labor and summarize
               all of the Bureau's activities of the preceeding month. Major projects within each
               division are monitored, including progress on survey work for the studies eventually
               published in the BULLETIN. Reports also provide overviews of the Bureau's lobbying
               and legislative consulting activities, its consultations with private groups and businesses
               and labor representatives, as well as its public service and educational activities.
               </div>
            <div class="para"> Annual summaries (1922-1932) provide summary material similar to that found in the
               monthly reports but emphasize the annual, rather than the monthly, perspective. </div>
            <div class="para"> Conferences of the Women's Bureau (1918-1965) constitute the largest component of
               Part 1. The conferences document the key issues concerning the Bureau from one decade
               to the next, as well as the roles played by individuals, government agencies and private
               organizations. Included are conference transcripts, agenda, lists of participants,
               summary minutes and reports, speeches, and background correspondence relative to organizing
               the conferences. </div>
            <div class="para"> Speeches (1918-1958) and articles (1918-1947) of Women's Bureau officers were prepared
               for a wide variety of audiences and media and demonstrate the Bureau's policy positions
               on a wide range of topics as well as the extent of its educational efforts.</div>  </a>
