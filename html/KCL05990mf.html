            <div class="para">The Transport Workers Union of America [TWU] was founded by New York City subway workers
               in 1934, and then expanded to represent other transit employees across the United
               States. Their largest Local is Local 100, whose membership consists of New York City's
               mass transit workers. TWU also represents flight attendants, grounds crew, and maintenance
               workers for a number of airlines as well as employees of Amtrak, ConRail, and a few
               short line railroads. </div>
            <div class="para"> The TWU was one of the first unions to join the Congress of Industrial Relations
               [CIO], and was known for its left-leaning politics. One of TWU's founders and its
               first president, Mike Quill, was a close ally of the Communist Party USA before renouncing
               all ties in 1948. The TWU was also unique among railroad and transit unions in that
               it fostered close ties with the African-American community and the NAACP, included
               quotas for the hiring of African-Americans in its collective bargaining agreements,
               and supported a strong civil rights platform which advocated for a national platform
               to combat racism as well as combating the racism found among its own members. </div>
            <div class="para"> TWU started representing railway employees in 1954 when the United Railroad Workers
               of America [URRWA] on the Pennsylvania Railroad [PRR] voted to join the TWU. The URRWA
               was itself an outgrowth of the CIO's United Railway Organizing Committee, which was
               chartered in 1941 to organize non-operating employees on the railways. The Committee
               organized many different non-operating crafts, including carmen, car inspectors, food
               service workers, maintenance of way, and maintenance of equipment employees. Like
               the TWU, the URRWA was committed to strong union ideals, promoting racial equality,
               fighting discrimination, and serving as a counterpoint to the railroad brotherhoods
               of the AFL. The URRWA represented around 40,000 employees of the Pennsylvania Railroad;
               in order to increase their negotiating power, the Committee voted to affiliate with
               the TWU, thus forming the Railroad Division of the TWU. </div>
            <div class="para"> In the TWU's first two decades of existence, the International Executive Board was
               the highest governing authority in between conventions. The Board consisted of the
               International officers as well as members at large and met quarterly. In the 1950s,
               after the growth of the union, a smaller executive body was needed for efficiency's
               sake. The International Executive Council was established, and it took over most of
               the duties previously held by the Board, which now met only once a year.</div>  </a>
