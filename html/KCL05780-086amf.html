            <div class="para">The International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union was once one of the largest labor
               unions in the United States founded in 1900 by local union delegates representing
               about 2,000 members in cities in the northeastern United States. It was one of the
               first U.S. Unions to have a membership consisting of mostly females, and it played
               a key role in the labor history of the 1920s and 1930s. The union is generally referred
               to as the "ILGWU" or the "ILG". The ILGWU grew in geographical scope, membership size,
               and political influence to become one of the most powerful forces in American organized
               labor by mid-century. Representing workers in the women's garment industry, the ILGWU
               worked to improve working and living conditions of its members through collective
               bargaining agreements, training programs, health care facilities, cooperative housing,
               educational opportunities, and other efforts. The ILGWU merged with the Amalgamated
               Clothing and Textile Workers Union in 1995 to form the Union of Needle trades, Industrial
               and Textile Employees (UNITE). UNITE merged with the Hotel Employees and Restaurant
               Employees Union (HERE) in 2004 to create a new union known as UNITE HERE. The two
               unions that formed UNITE in 1995 represented only 250,000 workers between them, down
               from the ILGWU's peak membership of 450,000 in 1969.</div>  </a>

            <div class="para">Jasper Peyton was born in Richmond, Virginia. Peyton studied at the University of
               the Philippines (Manila), graduated from City College (New York), and was adjunct
               professor at Fordham University. He attended New York Theological Seminary and was
               ordained in 1982. From 1950 to 1969, Peyton worked as a pleater and patternmaker,
               and from 1969 until 1995, he was on staff at the International's Education Department
               and for a time, serving as the Assistant Education Director. He currently lives in
               Brooklyn, New York.</div>  </a>

            <div class="para">The Education Department records document activities across the entire period of the
               department's existence, with the bulk of the records covering the 1970s and 1990s.
               It contains papers from directors of the Education Department: Fannia Cohn, Mark Starr,
               Gus Tyler, and Kitty Krupat. </div>
            <div class="para"> The earliest documentation of the department's work is found in the Fannia Cohn papers
               (5780/049, 5780/049 P); these contain correspondence, subject files, speeches, photographs,
               and printed material from her work as director of the Educational Department. A microfilm
               copy of the Fannia Cohn papers held at the New York Public Library (5998 mf) complements
               the Kheel Center's holdings. Documentation of the work of another longtime leader
               of the Education Department, Mark Starr, is contained in these records (5780/166,
               5780/166 PUBS), as well as in a related collection from Starr on worker education
               programs (5243). </div>
            <div class="para"> Documentation of the work of Gus Tyler, who led the merged Education and Political
               Department after Mark Starr's retirement in 1960, is also contained in the ILGWU records
               (5780/052, 5780/088, 5780/096). Tyler's papers are complemented by those of Assistant
               Director Jasper Peyton (5780/086) and Special Projects Coordinator Beverly Shulman
               (5780/106). These collections contain routine correspondence and memoranda, reports,
               materials relating to training institutes, seminars, and conferences, and printed
               material. </div>
            <div class="para"> The papers of Kitty Krupat, who was serving as Education Director at the time of
               the ILGWU/ACTWU merger in 1995, constitute the entirety of Education Department records
               from the 1990s. They include correspondence, memoranda, reports, and financial records
               relating to the ILGWU's independent and collaborative education projects, including
               the Worker-Family Education Program, the Joint Union- University Committee on Labor
               Education, and the Consortium for Worker Education, as well as numerous trainings,
               conferences, and seminars. Also included in the files are materials from local unions
               and regional departments of the ILGWU, files on the Internationals' conventions, and
               reports to the General Executive Board. </div>
            <div class="para"> Local union's of the ILGWU established and maintained robust, ambitious educational
               departments early on in the international's history. As these groups grew in size
               and scope, the international office sought to coordinate and centralize educational
               programming for the union's members, culminating in the formation of the Educational
               Department in 1918. </div>
            <div class="para"> The department's programming included courses at the Workers' University at the Washington
               Irving High School in New York City, lectures at Unity Centers and Unity Houses in
               the northeastern United States, and other events. The educational offerings of the
               International's Education Department were varied, as had been the education departments
               of the local unions, and included not only classes in labor studies but also courses
               in languages, music, and the arts. The ILGWU's 1937 musical "Pins and Needles" exemplified
               the diversity of the union's programs. </div>
            <div class="para"> Directors of the Education Department, especially Fannia Cohn and Mark Starr, wrote
               extensively on the ILGWU's programs and worker education in general. Longtime director
               Gus Tyler not only directed the department, but also served as the ILGWU's on-staff
               scholar. In later years, the Education Department went beyond collaborating with other
               education organizations and arranging in-house programs to also supporting post-secondary
               education for union members and their families.</div>  </a>
