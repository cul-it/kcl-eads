            <div class="para">Founded in 1900 by local union delegates representing about 2,000 members in cities
               in the northeastern United States, the ILGWU grew in geographical scope, membership
               size, political influence to become one of the most powerful forces in American organized
               labor by mid-century. Representing workers in the women's garment industry, the ILGWU
               worked to improve working and living conditions of its members through collective
               bargaining agreements, training programs, health care facilities, cooperative housing,
               educational opportunities, and other efforts. In 1995, the ILGWU merged with the Amalgamated
               Clothing and Textile Workers Union (ACTWU) to form the Union of Needletrades, Industrial
               and Textile Employees (UNITE).</div>  </a>

            <div class="para">Beginning in March 1924, the ILGWU and the Joint Board of Cloak and Dressmakers' Union
               began negotiations with the Merchants' Ladies' Garment Association (jobbers), the
               Cloak, Suit and Skirt Manufacturers' Protective Association (manufacturers), and the
               American Cloak and Suit Manufacturers' Association (sub-manufacturers). When no agreement
               could be reached by June 1924, New York Governor Alfred E. Smith appointed a Special
               Advisory Commission consisting of George Gordon Battle (Chairman), Herbert Lehman,
               Arthur Wolf, Lindsay Rogers, and Bernard Schientag (State Industrial Commissioner).
               Representing the union and associations were Morris Hillquit (ILGWU), Samuel Blumberg
               (Merchants' Ladies' Garment Association) and William Klein (Cloak and Suit Manufacturers'
               Protective Association). Public hearings took place between June 17 and June 25, and
               on June 27, recommendations were submitted. Accepted by the union, sub-manufacturers,
               and manufacturers, the jobbers refused until July 7, 1924 when the Merchants' Association
               agreed to the terms of the Governors' Commission.</div>  </a>

            <div class="para">In an effort to bring about much needed change in the industry, the ILGWU led by President
               Morris Sigman, sought reform in the New York suit and cloak trade. On behalf of the
               workers, the union devised to restructure the industry through the requirement of
               union shops, sanitary conditions, unemployment insurance, regulation of the work week,
               and guidelines for investigating disputes. In March 1924, the ILGWU began negotiations
               for a new agreement with predominantly the Merchant Ladies' Garment Association (jobbers),
               but also the Cloak, Suit and Skirt Manufacturers' Protective Association (manufacturers)
               and the American Cloak and Suit Manufacturers' Association (sub-manufacturers). No
               agreement had been reached as of June 1924, and the union proposed to submit the issues
               to arbitration. With negotiations stalled, Governor Alfred E. Smith appointed a Special
               Advisory Commission consisting of George Gordon Battle, Bernard L. Shientag, Herbert
               H. Lehman, Arthur D. Wolf, and Lindsay Rogers to hold hearings and work out a basis
               for an agreement. </div>
            <div class="para"> The collection contains material from the Governor's Advisory Commission during its
               investigation. Included are bound books containing the various and official reports
               that were created during and for the investigation. There are the briefs, the memorandum
               on behalf of the union as well as the Industrial Council, transcripts of the hearings
               and meetings, supplementary recommendations, and the final recommendations on May
               20, 1926. Of particular interest is the extensive research done in the course of the
               investigation that provides a comprehensive assessment of the garment industry at
               that time. The reports comprise historical information, the current status of the
               industry, points of contention between the groups involved, the demands of reform
               from the union, many employment and earning statistics, wage and wage scale tables
               and garment output and price charts. </div>
            <div class="para"> For supplemental information, see collection 5780/161 Cloak Joint Board Governor's
               Advisory Commission on the Cloak, Suit, and Skirt Industry which contains the first
               hearing on June 17, 1924 of the Special Commission to study the situation in the Cloak
               and Suit Industry and be able to offer recommendations to avert any impending strike.
               The hearings are in bound volumes and include June 17-19, 1924; June 20-23, 1924;
               June 24-July 11, 1924; July 15-August 1, 1924; August 12-October 2, 1924; and January
               2-April 15, 1925. </div>
            <div class="para"> The Hearings continue into 1925, and additionally, there is the final Report of the
               Investigation from March 10, 1925. There are also additional reports that were created
               as the result of the investigation including "Wages and Wage Scales, 1925," Final
               Recommendations from May 1926, the Meeting of the Special Mediation Commission in
               the New York Cloak and Suit Industry from March 6, 1926 (same individuals involved).
               </div>
            <div class="para"> Also, additional material can be found in collection 5780/165 Governor Smith's Hearings
               and Arbitration Files which contains the typed transcripts from the hearings of the
               Special Commission appointed by Governor Smith to investigate and arbitrate the existing
               differences between the ILGWU and the associations of manufacturers and jobbers. Taking
               place at the office of the State Labor Department in New York City, the records contain
               hearings that date between July 15, 1924 and October 27, 1924. In the form of questions
               and answers between the Special Commission and the representatives of the ILGWU and
               manufacturers' associations, discussion focuses on the role of designers within manufacturing,
               conditions in the industry, the responsibility of jobbers and sub-manufacturers, and
               salary and wages.</div>  </a>
